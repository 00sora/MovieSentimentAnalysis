1iqco40,The dice game from Pirates of the Caribbean 2,mcz1tpf,2025-02-15 22:08:28,"It's a game called Liars Dice.  Each round, you have to up the bid.  That means either the number on the dice goes up, or the quantity goes up.  (So if a person says 4, 4s.  You can follow by saying 5, 4s or 4, 5s. You can't go backward)  now the trick is that your bid includes all of the dice on the table, not just the ones you can see, so there's a bunch of guesswork and bluffing going on.  This goes on until someone says ""liar"", at which point all dice are revealed and you find out if the person actually is lying.  The loser is whoever is wrong.  The loser of each round loses a die, so you eventually end up with a winner who is the only one with something still to roll.  Great game, my family plays it every Christmas!",titan-of-hunger

1iqco40,The dice game from Pirates of the Caribbean 2,mczkod8,2025-02-15 23:51:57,"It took me a while to understand the game.

It's a game of bluffs.  Players are given 5 dice to roll.   Everyone rolls one time.  Someone starts with a bid of sorts, naming the number of dice that have been rolled with a certain number.  A player saying ""three 6s"" is them guessing that of the dice rolled, 3 of them rolled a 6.  Next player has the chance to call their bluff or make their own bet.  It has to be a higher number of dice or a higher dice roll of same kr higher count (based on what is shown into the movie).  For instance, if someone says ""three 4s"", the next player can't go ""four 3s"".  Players have to constantly raise the stakes until someone calls the bluff.

If you call another player's bluff by calling them a liar, but it turn out that their bid was actually correct, you lose.  Which is what happens in the first game.

The one thing I still don't really get is how Will is suddenly free to leave with Bootstrap losing the second game.  Will's wager was a lifetime of servitude against acquiring the key.  Bootstrap MATCHED the wager, he didn't wager for Will's freedom.  I also assume 3+ players turns the game into a series of knockout runs, like rock-paper-scissors, but Will neither wins nor loses.  Davey just ends the game in frustration at Bootstrap taking his win against Will away, and tells Will he can leave when they make port.",Fools_Requiem

1iqco40,The dice game from Pirates of the Caribbean 2,md1mypg,2025-02-16 08:40:40,"Common game to play in Taiwanese bars. 

Setup: each player gets a cup, and 5 dice. You shake up the dice in the cup and cover the dice, taking a look at your dice, hiding the view from anyone else.

Gameplay: first person guesses how many dice of a single value is showing up across all the players. Let's say they say 3 3's.

If someone calls BS, everyone reveals their dice. If there are at least 3 3's, the one who called BS loses. In bars, that person needs to drink. If there are less than 3 3's, the person who said it needs to drink.

If no one calls BS, next person goes. They must call out a number of dice equal to or greater than the previous player (5 2's, 4 4's, 7 3's, etc). If you choose a number equal to (3 of something, your number needs to go up (3 4's, 3 5's, or 3 6's). Your count of dice can never go down (1 or 2 of anything).

Strategy comes with saying large enough of a number to force unrealistic guesses.",C2BSR

You have five dice under a count for each player that only they can see. They call out how many dice they believe there is total by face, either increasing the face value of the dice or the number of dice with the rule being they can’t go down. If one person suspects a callout is too high, they can call the player a liar by which all the dice are revealed. If the player who made the call out is correct, the person who called the person a liar loses. If the number of dice is incorrect, the person who made the call loses.

Each player tries to bet on how many of a certain number are on the table, out of all the dice including their own and the other players. So Will might see he has two threes, and he declares ""four threes"", betting that there are two more threes under the other players' cups. He doesn't know for sure, but he's trying to guess. 

You have to up your bet every round, but as you do so, it becomes more and more unlikely. You might only have two threes under your cup, but now you're betting *six threes,* so you need a good poker face to convince your opponents maybe you have more confidence in your bet than you really do. Maybe you can convince them that you really have, say, five threes under your cup, so your bet of six threes is a lot less risky. 

If your opponents suspect you're bluffing, they can call you a liar after your bet, which ends the round and everyone lifts their cups. 

If you place a bet, ""six threes,"" and there turn out to only be three, you're out. But if a player calls you a liar and there turn out to really be six threes, the player who accused you is out.",RaynSideways

1iqco40,The dice game from Pirates of the Caribbean 2,md6ezrj,2025-02-17 01:52:13,"Love liars dice, been playing it my whole life. Play it once a week with some old timers that are very good.

Seems everyone else explains the rules, but not so much the lying part. Since the bid always increases, many times people call out 5s or 6s because they don’t want to call a higher number of 2s 3s or 4s. This puts the next player in a tougher spot to make a call. “Five 6s” is a safer call then “Six 3s”. Now, does the table think I actually have 6s? Or was I just trying to save my skin? That’s where the lying is. 

Another aspect about lying comes in what we call a swirl. Let’s say 4 people in a row, all call that same number. Maybe it goes “Five 6s, then Six 6s, Seven 6s, then Eight 6s”. Do all 4 of those people really have 6s? And do you as the 5th player, even though you don’t have 6s, do you lie and call 6s? Or do you go against the swirl? 

If the players at the table can read you and guess what dice you have, you are at a disadvantage. It is more than just a random numbers game. Being unpredictable and lying is a key to winning.",Duh_Bear

1iqco40,The dice game from Pirates of the Caribbean 2,md1xkiy,2025-02-16 10:29:38,">When and why do you call someone a liar?

When you think the dice don't match their wager.

You use the wagers made each round to make educated guesses about the dice each player has.

1. Initially, people tend to make wagers they can cover

1. Then they make wagers they think they *and* the other players can cover

1. Finally they make wagers based on a hope and a prayer.

 If nobody calls ""liar"" you will inevitably get to mathematically impossible wagers (""16 3s!"" on 15 dice), but someone will call liar before then.

**Step 2** is where most of the strategy of the game takes place including knowing or having a rough idea of the probabilities of the wagers actually being present, reading the other players' tells and attitudes, etc.

>What is the strategic purpose of it?

To end the game before you're forced to make a wager in the category of **Step 3** from above where you yourself are likely to be wrong and get called a liar. If wagers are getting out of hand you should probably call ""liar"" just to save your own skin, even if you aren't sure the person is lying. It's that or be forced into a bad wager.

As for the game in the movie it makes no sense at all, contrary to the praise people like to lavish on it. Based on the version seemingly being played and considering that Bootstrap Bill is deliberately playing as a spoiler to thwart Davy Jones, Bill can cause Will to win simply by calling Will a liar as soon as possible. He can also cause himself to lose by making an outrageous wager that will make Jones call him out (which is what happens).

The only way Jones's interactions during the game in the movie make sense is if you accept that Jones is so completely alienated from the idea of love that he is literally incapable of understanding that Bill plans to sacrifice himself for Will at the most basic level of intelligence. Obviously, as soon as **Step 3** from above is reached Bill will throw the game and stop Jones from claiming Will. The more you think about it the less sense it all makes (who's allowed to participate, when challenges are allowed to be made, Bill entering, playing, and throwing the game sub-optimally, etc.).",nixolympica

The benefit of calling someone's lie is so you don't have to lie yourself since your wager will be less likely than whatever theirs is since the numbers keep increasing.

You can call someone a liar at any time - including not on your turn, but usually you would do it on your turn so that you don't have to make a higher bid.

You'll usually have a pair of numbers in your hand, let's say two fives, so bet three fives (depending on how many dice your opponents have there'll likely be at least one more). Your opponents will raise that to, say, four fives, then five fives, then the odds if there actually being that many decreases dramatically. If you're lucky, your opponents will call a bluff on each other without you having to bet a die of your own, but if not call the bluff yourself. I generally find the AI bluffs a lot so if you try and be truthful and don't go extravagant in your betting you'll probably win. Always keep a note of how many dice are left in play as well, yours and your opponents.

Two examples:
- in *At World’s End* they have an elaborate backstory between Jack, the East India Trading Company, and his refusal to trade people that resulted in his branding. Tell that story! Don’t leave it as subtext
- *Dead Men Tell No Tales* had Javier freakin Bardem as an awesome sea captain get outmaneuvered and an army crippled by Jack in a flashback! I would have been much more interested in that than the trident of destiny mcguffin thing.

Also, the main characters were great but the whole Pirates trilogy doesn't get enough credit for the writing of the minor characters like Gibbs, Pintel, Cotton, Swann, and the two British soldiers.   All of them were characters with their own minds and different priorities than the mains.

I personally think CoTBP would have been fine on its own no sequels but that's not the Disney way, success = sequel it seems. And they paid off imo. 

But I feel like most people's gripes from my experience are that it's not the cgi, the story, the new characters but Jack Sparrows character development.
In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3. It feels like they went ""okay Johnny do it just like you did first time but.. More"".

Bill Nighy’s performance as Davy Jones is stellar; the blend of his voice acting with the great visual effects make Davy Jones still one of my favorite villain representations in a long time. 

The stakes feel much higher in this movie and the character’s motivations really get dug into through the film. The themes of sacrifice running through Bootstrap and Jack and Davy Jones makes them feel like real characters with motivations rather than just pirates.

You can tell that the writers and director were truly swinging for the fences and even if they missed more often than not, at least they tried. The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind. Elizabeth's speech, the maelstrom, the fights, the wedding in the middle of the fights, all with some epic Hans Zimmer music, and then the cherry on top of the destruction of Beckett's ship in slow motion.

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top.

I have to disagree.

Maybe its just because I hated the third film so much but I found *On Stranger Tides* refreshing; the ending scene also concludes Jack's story arch involving his search for immortality. And while the fifth film is definitely rote, its ending scene is a perfect farewell to the characters, even if the movie as a whole wasn't.

The first three are solid narratively because of the two leads:  Elizabeth and Will. They both have goals and drive and great character development.

Jack is not a main character. He is a plot device. A really damned good plot device, but his character is not suited to serving as the primary protagonist.

It wasn't just two sides, one trying to destroy it, one defending it, but lots of different characters having different motivations to do either. The amount of planning, crossing, double crossing, making deals, breaking them, stealing, buying, hiding, finding, made it really interesting to follow and try and work out the best outcome for everyone.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

It was a mostly normal and mortal world, and then had this one out of place fantasy element with the cursed pirates to give it a twist. In Curse of the Black Pearl the pirates were just pirates--normal people being debaucherous in Tortuga, in At World's End the pirates are part of a mystical society that can summon an ocean god with a semi-spiritualistic death hymn. If you look up ""jumping the shark,"" the first result should be this movie trilogy.

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work."" But then Elizabeth was like ""are you fucking kidding me? All this effort gone to waste? Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.

epmxxj,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest and At World’s End are fantastic when watched back-to-back,fektxzp,2020-01-16 20:45:37,"It is a heroes journey. (okay, but that is totally generic)

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

* **Beauty and the Beast (2017)** - The Disney train just keeps on rolling as Beauty and the Beast became the 8th movie to ever pass $500M domestic. Now half of the $500M grossers are Disney films with all of them coming out in the last five years (the other three are The Force Awakens, The Avengers, and Rogue One). Disney has clearly cornered the market on domestic sales and could easily see another enter the $500M range with The Last Jedi being released later this year.

* **The Fate of the Furious** - It wasn't just Disney adding a new member to an elite club, as Universal's Fate of the Furious passed $1B in international sales this week. This is just the 6th film to do so and the first time ever two films from a franchise have passed that marker (Furious 7 also made $1B internationally). Also Fate of the Furious has now passed Iron Man 3 in worldwide gross making FotF the 11th highest grossing film of all time. 

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** - Guardians 2 has now surpassed the original in both domestic ($333.2M) and worldwide gross ($783.3M). Now the big question is if the film will become the first non-RDJ starring MCU film to crack $1B. 

**Notable film closings**

* **Moonlight** - The very acclaimed and surprise (in more ways than one) Best Picture winner has now closed to an incredible $27.8M domestic and $65M worldwide on a budget of just $1.5M. The film was made on a shoestring budget to the point that Oscar nominee Naomi Harris literally had to film here scenes in just three days. As such the film looked to be closing around $10M or so before the Oscar buzz but nominations and awards helped propel to becoming the highest grossing release for A24, even topping films that played in twice as many theaters like Ex Machina and The VVitch. Moonlight is an undeniable success, one that proves Oscars matter in terms of getting small films like Moonlight seen by much larger audiences. 

* **Your Name** - The little anime that could closed in the US to an incredible $4.8M domestic and $354.3M worldwide on an unknown but likely small budget. The anime was a massive success in both Japan and China where it broke previous animation box office records and become something of a cultural touchstone for youths in both nations. In the US the film didn't quite catch on but it never saw a release of more than 300 theaters and maintained good per theater averages throughout its run. Ultimately US is a blip in comparison to the rest of the world, where the film was a monumental success in multiple countries. 

* **The Belko Experiment** - The latest from Blumhouse closed to a small if solid $10.1M domestic and $10.3M worldwide on a budget of $5M. The film from writer James Gunn received mix reviews but ultimately doubled its budget and likely played well in VOD which is more the goal of the BH Tilt title it was released under. It should be noted this meager sum is actually the second highest gross for BH Tilt which should tell you that meager sums is the name of the game. 

* **CHIPS** - While Baywatch is certainly gunning for it, CHIPS saw an equally awful performance closing to a pathetic $18.6M domestic and $25.5 worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film by Dax Shepard was savaged by critics and could barely even top its small production budget and will almost certainly be a loss Warner Bros. when marketing is counted in. It seems likely the utter failure of this film and Baywatch might put an end to all the 21 Jump St. clones out there. 

* **Ghost in the Shell (2017)** - The controversial anime film closed to a disappointing $40.5M domestic and $169.8M worldwide on a budget of $110M. The film received a lot of criticism for its whitewashing of the main character, even Paramount claiming that's why the film failed. However I think even more at heart is that frankly US audiences don't care about untested properties and that turning a heady anime that's not super well known by mass audiences into an action film just upsets both sides and no one wins. That said certainly GitS will join Exodus: Gods and Kings, Pan, and Gods of Egypt as notably whitewashed movies that were still colossal bombs despite having ""A list"" actors to give them international appeal.

Also, Covenant underperforming is a real shame, that universe could have been so cool if it had gone in another direction. Im a big fan of the first two, and I was going to see it, but.. I just can't get behind where they went with the story. I really liked Prometheus, my feelings are so conflicted on it. It's such a cool and in many ways great sci-fi movie, but they *fucked* up the Alien mythology. No other way to say it. They took the mysterious, creepy and fascinating Bone ship and Space Jockey, and took a huge steaming dump on it with this Engineer garbage. The idea is really cool, if it had been its own story. But setting it in the Alien universe to explain the xeno's, and the derelict etc was a *terrible* idea.

The biggest of my problems with this film is with Johnny Depp. In the first few movies you could see that behind Jack Sparrow's eccentric behaviour, lies a feeling human. You really had to give props to Depp for having given such a layered performance. At least in the first one. But now this facade Jack Sparrow showes as his character, is the whole of his character.

I just assume that many people feel the same way as I do: 

I was excited for a new horror movie with Aliens and what I got was a  search for space god. Which could have been interesting if it wasn't so poorly written with boring characters.

So when the sequel comes along with, let's just say, less then stellar reviews and a protagonist with the screen presence of a wet blanket, I'm sure as hell not going to open my wallet to see it in the cinema.

Which makes me think: why does Ridley Scott, and everybody else for that matter, seem to think he is in any way entitled or even qualified to develop the Alien mythos or whatever you wanna call it.

It gives casual audiences the impression that its quality is based on a hundred point scale when in reality it is a percentage of likes vs dislikes.  There is a vast gulf between like and dislike, however.  Movies that may generally be liked may not be loved, conversely movies that may be disliked may be hated.  For example, John Wick 2 was enjoyable but there were problems that reduced the score for me to an B/80, yet it scored on the Tomatometer similar to The Raid which is a classic.  

Tomatometer is a double edged sword, it's easier to score high - and low, and with casual audiences misperceiving its meaning, exacerbating the feast or famine results at the box office.  For example, I and others who watched King Arthur loved it but the Tomatometer score from reading through its threads scared people off.  I could see how divisive it could be but on balance and with a 1-10 rating system, should've at least been 40 percent (it's a 46 on RT's average critic score, 42 on Metacritic)

Movies are huge bets but RT scores are taking out the middle ground
 which will ultimately result in even fewer risky movies, midrange movies, and more franchises as Hollywood will seek to hedge bets with international ie big budget action.

The solution is already available on RT as it has the average critic scores.  It is this number that should be promoted to more accurately reflect a movie's quality, true gems and bombs will stand out, and the movies in the middle will be up to audiences to decide rather than an all too easy casual dismissal based on a misleading score.

It's funny you mention Sears.  They did fail to adequately adapt and recognize a changing market.   They were the largest retailer and got stuck with a vast amount of real estate that failed to generate revenue (shuttered Sears, Kmart retail stores).  Some of their holdings were converted into data centers.

The current trend for market segmentation will be an unmitigated disaster.  Consumers don't want to pay twenty businesses for 20 services.  Market segmentation offers choices, but often creates too many headaches.

Consumers want to pay one provider a reasonable fee with access to everything or have a choice to pay for what they want.  i.e. a la carte model.

Netflix's success is based on this consumer friendly model with reasonable rates and access to a diverse content library.

Hollywood has been trying to crack the China market for awhile now, but has had a difficult time due to protectionism in China.  The Chinese government has various restrictions on imports.

There are only so many foreign films each year permitted in China.  To get around that restriction, a film must be co-produced with a Chinese company, include Chinese actors, and have a certain amount of production in China.

That's why you see all these Hollywood blockbusters including plots or scenes in China.",breakr5

The simple fact is the budgets ARE that high. They set themselves up to need to not just make a billion to break even, but to make well past a billion. It's nuts. Meanwhile, they don't realize that all us fans care about is characters we love and good stories. 

They could make the next Fast and Furious or Pirates movie for $150M or something instead of $300M, and it would still make a billion. But for some reason all they think is ""bigger! bigger! bigger!""",SetYourGoals

- Blomkamp is really, really good at VFX. This is just a fact. Even if you found everything after District 9 underwhelming (which I did, too), the technical elements of those films were very well done, especially the action scenes and integrating real actors with CGI components. Everyone seems to agree covenant's CGI was pretty bad in places, I think this is one area where he'd actually be better than Scott.

- Blomkamp's biggest problem has been that he writes his own scripts and he's not as good at that as he thinks he is. In this case, he would have been directing someone else's script so his shitty writing wouldn't have undermined his fantastic VFX work. 

- it would have been a direct continuation of the original films' plot and not a prequel that seems like it was written as an entirely separate franchise and then pasted the Aliens in later for brand recognition

Jack, Will, and Elizabeth SHARED the lead roles in the first trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Depp was undeniably the star, but in terms of screen time and character interactions, all three were the major players in those movies. They balanced each other out, with each character having their own arcs that ultimately carried the trilogy.

But having Jack as the sole lead in the last two films simply isn't as interesting. There's just too much of him now, and every supporting character (even Barbossa) is relegated to simply reacting off of Jack's quirkiness instead of challenging him like Will and Elizabeth constantly did. Everyone likes to rag on the romantic subplot of the first trilogy but it actually took up so little screen time. Shit, Will and Elizabeth spent a majority of the sequels on their own, trying to find each other. In At World's End they were even hostile to one another.

In other words Will and Elizabeth were a central part to what made the trilogy work so well. They just tend to get overlooked because of Depp's ability to steal his scenes and make it look like he was carrying the movies, when that simply wasn't the case at all.",thefablemuncher

The thing is, the ""Guy Ritchieiest"" moments regarding dialogue/editing and all that are the best parts of the movie (and seeing Littlefinger play a good guy). But the script is terribly written and the film is horrendously paced and the ""King Arthur"" moments are pretty bad as far as I'm concerned.

The movie kind of reminded me of Suicide Squad, in that it starts out very stylized before losing most of that style later on. The only difference is, Suicide Squad loses it completely, while King Arthur has enough of it popping up occasionally to remind you that a better movie could have existed.

Frankly, I think it would have been better if it wasn't a King Arthur movie at all, or at least not about King Arthur himself. I kept thinking that if this was a movie about how street rats and hoodlums pounced on the opportunities King Arthur's revolution would create to establish themselves as quasi-allies of him while simultaneously becoming climbing ranks in the criminal underworld, we'd have a much more interesting movie.",HopelessCineromantic

It's not a simple thumbs up or down - RT staff check each critic's review and assign it a score to calculate the tomato rating. An official RT movie score means at least 5 critics reviewed it and consider it ""good"". A ""fresh"" movie means it has a RT score of 60%. ""Rotten"" is anything below. Let's say all that means that 5 critics could gave it a 4/5 which results in 100% fresh.

Say there's a movie with where 5 critics rated it a 3/5, and 5 rated it a 4/5, which gives it a 50%. To finesse that score, they could:
- change what it means to be ""good"". If good means 3/5 instead of 4/5, suddenly the score is 100% again
- change what it means to be a critic. If they include a lot more critics than before, they can get the score boosted simply by adding to the pool. Maybe they approve bloggers or YouTube channels who tend to rate movies highly. In this example, adding 3 bloggers with 4/5 ratings turns the good/bad ratio into 8:5, which comes out to 61% - that's fresh!
- change the threshold for certifying a movie as fresh. If they decide 50% of critics is good enough, then suddenly this movie is 100% fresh again.
- change how they internally score reviews. Some critics use star ratings, some use thumbs up/down, some don't give a score at all but simply talk about the movie's successes and failures. There is a lot of room for interpretation there which could easily bump a movie a few percentage points.

They will probably do a combination of all these things. And I have no doubt they will. There have been studies showing that the ratings that Fandango shows in its app are almost always higher than the average of other sources.

Edit: I'm using these numbers just because they're good for the example, but they don't accurately represent how the actual tomatometer works. I believe the general concepts are accurate though.

tl;dr - you can change the variables for an RT score to improve it",nearcatch

The movie is also not really about bay watch. It's a police comedy that happens to be set on the beach. Bay watch was always about lifeguards, not about lifeguards who thought they were cops. 

And as someone else said, the tv show was unintentionally funny. It wasn't a comedy but rather a ""so bad it's funny"" type show that was self aware. The movie tries to be a straight up comedy. 

I'd also say that the BT show had a very strong moral compass and had heart. It was always a little too wholesome.

It was a dramatic-action type show that took itself a little too seriously and wound up unintentionally campy, Hasselhoff's signature move, though I think they were more self-aware and played along with it in later seasons.

That campiness, combined with it's inoffensiveness and clicheed happy-endings-with-heart, gave it a sort of charm that made it an acceptable guilty pleasure. Nobody considered it ground-breaking television, but you weren't necessarily ridiculed for openly admitting to watch it, either.

if that was true (more) ""arthouse"" movies would make millions and millions at the box office.

over-the-top special effects and spectacle definitely plays a *huge* part for many people deciding to watch a movie in the theatre instead of waiting for it to be available at home.

Hell, the second and third movie could have possibly gone on without Jack. It wouldn't have been as interesting, but could have gone ahead.

To me it looks like Covenant should be able to roughly break even at worst with its theatrical run, and make it's way to an OK-at-best profit from blu ray sales, merchandise, and what not. It also looks like if they do make another one, getting a big budget is probably not on the table; depending on how the Scott/studio balance of power went in production, they might decide to exert more or less influence as well. And making a sequel at all might just be off the table entirely.

Interestingly, the series has never been a big box office record breaker. Alien and Aliens were very financially successful, but only because they had low production budgets; they brought in about $100m and $130m, respectively. That's very successful for when they came out, but the franchise hasn't really zoomed much past that in the years since. Alien 3 and Resurrection brought in about $160m each, and Prometheus was the most successful by far, at about $400m.

I'd lean towards lowering the budgets to account for the apparent core audience size in order to maintain profitability.",Geistbar

That's a pretty starkly different type of characterization from, say, Moonlight. Complex doesn't mean better to a huge portion of the population. The Big Bang Theory pulls way higher numbers than Breaking Bad ever did. But the characters and the story are what people love about both those shows, or the Fast movies, as different as they are.

Talent participation deals used to be based on net earnings vs. gross earnings. So some shady companies would try to shield profits from participation deals. But that's long since gone away, agents don't make those deals anymore. Even the most publicized instance of this, Forrest Gump, ended up being a total falsehood, admitted by the author who made the allegation. But only the ""Forrest Gump made no profit!??!?!"" headline sticks in people's heads.

Cruise seems to be really good in every movie I've seen and be largely in really good movies, yet I still don't want to see a Tom Cruise movie? Has he made good returns in the last 10ish years? Not that I don't think the mummy won't be panned.

Suicide Squad could have cost twice as much and been...what, 10% better? I think there's a point of diminishing returns on budget, but the studios can't seem to let that sink in.

-That case is Stan Lee suing Marvel **Comics** about a bunch of different properties. It includes Fox movies, Sony movies, Universal movies, etc. Marvel eventually [settled with him,](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/marvel-settles-with-a-spiderman-creator.html), but it's certainly not ""Hollywood accounting."" It's Marvel not paying Lee, not a movie studio.

-New Line was a shitty production company, not a studio, and they settled with Jackson. 

-The Stallone thing we need to hear the WB side of, we've only heard Stallone's complaint, but again, that's one of those 3 decade old deals that they don't make anymore, and seems more like WB Home Ent just fucking up in 1997 and then trying to cover their asses when someone asked about it 20 years later. 

Other big instances that get brought up a lot:

- My Big Fat Greek Wedding - Production company, not studio. And the plaintiffs [dropped that case, with no settlement, and were apparently paid $44M in profit participation as their contract dictated.](http://www.eonline.com/news/20525/hanks-drops-suit-against-greek-wedding-parties)

- Winston Groom + Forrest Gump - ""I wasn't suing Paramount,"" Groom said. ""I had a question about the royalty statement, which I didn't understand. When I spoke to Paramount I was assured everything was OK. I'm delighted with this agreement."" [Source.](http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Gump-Author-Settles-Fight-With-Studio-3031365.php) This quote is a month after that story blew up, and it's still the #1 most cited incidence of ""hollywood accounting."" Even though it's bullshit, the man was paid, and the bigger profit participants were on gross deals, not net. Also that was decades ago.

I've seen some funky things with moving money around from x department to y department, especially with P&A money, depending on where it's advantageous to show profit or loss for the company. But that's not ""hollywood accounting."" Hollywood Accounting is hiding profits in order to fuck people who made participation deals. They don't do that anymore, and I'm not convinced it was widespread 30 years ago. With the rise of CAA and talent power, those deals just don't happen, and the studios would be caught, in court, and no talent would work with them.

The Stallone thing is specifically about residuals and continuing profits, not the initial movie. But you're right, even that may be governed by a very old deal.

As for the ones with production companies instead of studios, you seem to have a narrower definition of Hollywood accounting than I do. Even if it's a production company instead of a studio, the end goal seems to be the same, and the people making these predatory deals are definitely following the examples of yesteryear.

No that's just not what it is. Commonly the term is used only to describe the practice of saying a profitable movie has not made a profit, so that you do not have to pay out profit participation on deals that only kick in at certain profit levels. It's a very specific thing, and it's pretty rare for a production company to be in the position to even commit this. The kinds of talent deals we are talking about are made by the studios the vast majority of the time. The examples you specifically cited were a comic book company sort of doing it and a 30 year old deal pertaining to downstream revenue that we have no idea about the validity of. If this was happening we'd have tons of examples, there would be lawsuits left and right. Don't take my word for it, ask anyone in the industry, especially at a major agency. They wouldn't structure talent deals in a way that even allows this to be a possibility. Maybe they used to, but the talent has power now. 

New Line wasn't a production company created for accounting a movie though. It was one of the largest and most insular production companies, and they were in a particular position of control on LOTR as they had the rights, funded it, etc, not a traditional studio like WB. New Line was a part of Time Warner, but it was still very independent. If I had to guess, Michael Lynne who was COO at New Line, might have unilaterally made the call not to pay out the participations, especially to Jackson. They didn't like Jackson, I think they were mad that he got all the credit, and they were still seen as outsiders by Hollywood. That's what it looks like at least. There's a really good Vanity Fair piece on them from a long time ago that is worth a read, the company has a weird and interesting story. 

And sorry I wasn't saying YOU are super bitter or not in the industry or whatever, sorry if it came off that way, I was typing that quickly running around on my phone. I'm just saying that there's an odd amount of vitriol that comes from people when they are told the ""hollywood accounting"" thing is essentially a trumped up myth. You're smart and having a discussion and clearly open to learning, finding sources, etc. I'm concurrently dealing with a guy who challenging the fact that I even work in the industry, calling me names, etc. Over some ""here's how the business works"" comment I made. It's happened before a couple times too. I've spoken with other people in the industry who post here, and they said they've had the same arguments with angry people over the Hollywood accounting thing. So, my only idea on why they are so angry is that they are bitter about the industry in general, for whatever personal reasons, and they always saw this as a great thing to point to about Hollywood. It's truly odd how resistant people are to this specific idea (and also finding out how the box office returns and film profitability actually works, same reaction a lot of the time). 

I've yet to see a compelling argument that this happens, it wasn't happening at two of the three major studios I've worked at (I couldn't look at accounting info at the third). Accounting firms would meticulously audit us pretty frequently, even the small budgets that I handled. I'm sure some weird shit goes on with the money. Taxes and interest and department shifting. But to think the studios are royally screwing over the major talent on giant tentpole movies (which is where I usually see this brought up) is just not possible. It would be front page news on Deadline every day. ",SetYourGoals

I've pretty meticulously sifted through the budgets of giant movies at two major studios. I was personally responsible for the accounting on smaller roughly $10M budgets at these studios, but that gave me access to see all the numbers. This stuff interests me so, I looked at as much as I could. 

So the director of Emily Rose says he didn't get any money from a 5% net deal. Assuming he's correct, which he very well may not have been, there are some obstacles to profitability there. Usually those deals are tiered, to start with, so maybe they don't kick in until after X amount of box office or X amount of profit. So say it's 5% of everything after $20M in profit or something. So they don't have big participation, but if it's some Exorcist or Paranormal Activity runaway hit, they get a good piece. That would be pretty standard for a first time director I'd guess, which he was. Then look at the actual box office. The movie probably brought in roughly $37M domestic, and $24M international or so, give or take, so let's call it a $60M return. The production budget was listed at $19M. This had a pretty heft marketing spend I would think, several times the cost of the budget. I looked on Wikileaks, but this movie was too old to have good theatrical profit data on there or the total marketing budget. I did find the marketing budget for Taiwan, which you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/BtbgVsl.png) or get from Wikileaks with an easy search. $4M in Taiwan alone for marketing, where it made $1,170,319 at the box office. I'd conservatively guess the marketing budget/releasing costs for the US were $35-40M, and maybe the same for the rest of the world combined, hard to know. It could be a lot higher but I'm being conservative for the sake of argument here. 

Now we're looking at a lot more than $60M in costs. So...yes, it's very possible that they did not turn a theatrical profit on the movie, in fact it seems likely that they didn't. I'm sure they hit profitability with TV and this was the heyday of DVD, but I'm not sure a first time director would have any downstream participation. 

Sounds like a case where the guy just had a bad deal, and the movie didn't make any money in theaters, and they spent way too much on marketing back then. 

The Harry Potter thing is just internal weird bookkeeping for WB. They paid themselves a distribution fee, moved money, etc. But if they were fucking people over with this, as people like to imply, the second this document hit deadline they'd be up to their eyes in lawsuits from the cast and producers. Who gives a shit what their internal system is? Also, looking at that doc, this looks like it's just a distribution sheet. Where is the production budget? That was reportedly $150M. And they they spent $131M just on the ad buys. $60M more in other smaller marketing and fee costs. And they got $460M in box office returns, based on this document. I'll admit I don't get a ton about distribution costs, they've always been very separate from anything I've done, but it isn't exactly insane that there weren't overwhelming profits from a movie they spent $350M to make and got $460M in box office. They made $100M, they moved money, minimized taxes, etc. That's corporations. Why do you or anyone have a problem with this unless it's screwing over the talent? You have a problem with the entire idea of corporate accounting? Hollywood Accounting means a pretty specific thing. Shielding the studio from having to pay net participation deals by erroneously showing no profits. 

I agree corporate accounting is batshit crazy, I don't think companies like the studios, or Apple or any other huge company, should get to avoid taxes with loopholes. But that's not what people are talking about when they scream ""Hollywood Accounting!"" The common definition just isn't something that's going on in the modern entertainment industry. ",SetYourGoals

I think one of the biggest problems (that each Pirates movie built on) is the development of the three main characters. In Curse, Jack is not the main protagonist. He’s the sidekick foil to Will. And yes, he does have some goofy moments, but in Curse he’s much more of a clever, conniving character. Each movie subsequently made him dumber, goofier, and more clearly “the main character”. Will is the traditional hero of Curse, going through a hero arc and realizing that pirates aren’t all bad. He’s stubborn and naive, but also caring and brave. The sequels mostly just have him around for action and the “save Dad vs marry Elizabeth” choice. Elizabeth gets more of an arc in the sequels, but they don’t build much on her initial character. She remains stubborn, headstrong, and adventurous, while getting into more and more crazy situations. Honestly, Norrington and Davy Jones have the best character development in the sequels.

Pirates 1 motivations are pretty straight forward:

* Jack: Wants the Black Pearl and generally money
* Will: Wants to save Elizabeth
* Norington: Wants to save Elizabeth and marry her
* Barbossa & Crew: Wants the curse lifted

Pirates 2 and 3 motivations get a lot more complex and alliances shift over the course of the films:

* Jack: Wants to get out of his deal with Davy Jones and never die
* Will: Wants to get his dad back from Davy Jones
* Elizabeth: Wants a pardon so they can live happily ever after
* Davy Jones: Just doing his job and pissed at Calypso
* Norington: Wants to get his station back and regain honor
* Gibbs & Crew: Wants to survive and make $
* Bootstrap Bill: Wants to save his son
* Capt Feng: Wants to release Calypso
* Tia Dalma: Wants to be released I guess

When I first saw the film at the cinema in 2006 it blew me away. At World’s End had promise, but it devolved into a confusing and dissatisfying mess by its end.

So, somehow, every time I come back DMC after some years it continues to surprise and delight me. It’s brilliant.

Sure, there are plenty of “only in the movies” moments that conveniently help to move things along, but none of them ruin the thrust of the film.

I know with how complicated the MCU is now, they basically made Iron Man's last suit iterations nanotech and much more ""fluid"" so that the CGI would probably be simpler, but I really love going back and seeing how much effort went into the first suit (I'm pretty sure they made an actual model of his suit), and the weight felt pretty believable.

I can relate with this sentiment. These movies were very dear to me too.

5 absolutely. 5 is a disgrace to the franchise. Funnily, I think 4 respeced the characters. Jack, Hector and Gibbs were the same as before. It's just that the story for 4 was boring and without the Pearl and most of the earlier crew, it felt a bit empty.

Gore's trilogy is indeed a fantastic story with a great conclusion. 4 is a fun spinoff story if you want more of Jack and Hector. ignore 5 by all means.",Boss452

*At World's End* is clearly a conclusion. Just like *Return of the Jedi* is a conclusion, or like how *Matrix Revolutions* is a conclusion. You shouldn't have yet another sequel after the conclusion.

Some movies aren't resolutions in the usual sense, but are a kind of good farewell to the characters, like *Toy Story 3* or *The Last Crusade*, and yet they too get further sequels.

In the first film, all of those characters' subplots all tied into the central plot. While they do in the sequel, as well, that central plot is more a MacGuffin than a story. It's a bunch of independent threads coming together because of the chest, but so much of those threads requires a ton of exposition which makes the film feel overstuffed. The first film was *The Black Pearl* crew's motivation against the motivations of the other parties to save Elizabeth (Will and Norrington) or save their ship (Jack and the other pirates) - since those opposing Barbosa all have a goal that lends to each other, it flows so much more naturally. 

In *Dead Man's Chest*, it's ""I wanna free my Daddy,"" ""I wanna save my fiancé (even though I'm doubting I want to),"" ""I'm not sure what I want, but I wanna not be killed by the Kraken,"" ""I don't want these fuckers to stab my heart,"" and ""I'm not sure what I want, but, hey, everyone else wants this thing, so I must want it too."" No one really shares any motivations, so it's a juggle. This movie starts the clusterfuck of backstabbing that makes the cup flow over in the third film. It's all engineered drama, where the first excelled at the characters' all sharing a motivation while having different goals - the sequel is different goals *and* different motivations, but driven to claim the same solution.

To me, Pirates 4 felt like a continuation that was at least hinted at after At World's End. I know it's hard for the movie to feel as much like a Pirates movie because the trilogy was wrapped up nicely and ended some important character arcs. It's a good thing they didn't bring them back (looking at you 5), but at the same time I can't deny I'm biased with 4 because I'm a fan of Barbossa.

I know everyone loves Jack Sparrow but I personally loved Hector Barbossa more as a character. He just feels like the most pirate-y pirate out of them all, and in a way Pirates 4 is basically seeing Barbossa go through the same arc Jack did in the first Pirates movie. We don't see him reduced to something weak, instead we see Barbossa conquering his newfound weakness and going for revenge against a notoriously feared pirate.

You can't include del toro's stuff as prep for the Hobbit films that ended up getting made. Del Toros stuff was scrapped because it wasn't visually consistent with Jacksons LOTR. It was more whimsical and fairy tale-ish. Jackson started from essentially scratch and only had 6 months of prep.

When you consider in year releases, I always consider Three Men and a Baby, released in 1987 to be one of the most inconsequential films to be the highest grossing film released in its year.

We generally hold up any 80s hit in high nostalgia, especially kid friendly classics. But no one talks about that film. There's been no serious attempts at rebooting or legacy sequels.

It could be because I grew up with those Batman movies and haven’t seen any of the transformer movies that I don’t remember the transformer movie, But also, Batman forever is not a good movie.

If If we remember Batman forever, it’s for how bad it is, how stacked the cast, bat nipples and Jim Carrey. Personally I don’t want to say it’s bad because I think it does have some campy value to it, But even then, some of the camp is bad and it’s not on the same level as the Michael Keaton or Christian Bale Batman’s.

I could also say Iron Man three because I do not remember that movie at all and I don’t think it it holds up in the conversation of superhero movies. The way the original Iron Man does or the avenger movies.

And lastly, I think who framed Roger rabbit is probably the most forgotten in the sensitive is a really good movie, but I just don’t hear people talking about it.

The Star Wars films, because they were bad and I only recognize 4/5/6/Rogue One as the franchise.

Avatar. No reason in particular. We watched it on release, it was fine, never had a desire to watch it again. 

Bad Boys for life, wasn’t good, and I like the first two. I’d rather just watch those.

1gcjljd,"Of the highest grossing domestic movies of the last 40 years, which are the most forgotten?",ltvljbj,2024-10-26 17:11:30,"Hmm... gut feeling:

* Ghost
* Batman Returns
* Batman Forever
* Batman
* Beverly Hills Cop 2
* Bad Boys for Life
* How the Grinch Stole Christmas
* Who Framed Roger Rabbit (might as well make a top ten, so...)
* Top Gun
* Barbie (seriously, I never see anyone talking about it any more)

I feel like the only Batman films anyone actually talks about are the 21st Century ones.

Let's be a bit more systematic though.

What I'm going to do is obtain:

* Tratio = number of critic reviews at RT / (mean \# critic reviews at RT for films from that year from my dataset)
* Iratio = the same thing but for the number of IMDB ratings
* Mratio = the same thing but for the number of *user* ratings at Metacritic

and then take the mean of these numbers. Lower mean ratio = more forgotten. At least, that's the idea.

Broadly speaking, my dataset consists *either* of the top five films Domestically (""in year release"") **or** the top ten films Worldwide. The difference is whether I grabbed the films just now (1984-1990) or I already had them (1991-2023). There are quite a lot of extra films though which may be polluting matters. Also, I was too lazy to find the actual counts for IMDB so I just took the floor, e.g. Ghostbusters is 461k = 461,000, because it's a real pain in the fucking arse to get the actual counts nowadays.

Okay, so results *for the films you listed* (most forgotten to least forgotten; top ten least forgotten):

1. Ghost
2. How the Grinch Stole Christmas
3. Who Framed Roger Rabbit
4. Finding Dory
5. Batman Forever
6. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
7. Jurassic World
8. Beverly Hills Cop II
9. Bad Boys for Life
10. Shrek 2

I don't agree with the inclusions of Jurassic World and Shrek 2 here but, yeah, how'd I forget about Revenge of the Fallen? Who now bothers to talk about a Bayformers movie that isn't the first one? If you do so, you treat them collectively. And Finding Dory also ""feels right"", even though I omitted it from my list.",FrameworkisDigimon

1gcjljd,"Of the highest grossing domestic movies of the last 40 years, which are the most forgotten?",ltvxl7n,2024-10-26 18:17:26,"I worked for Paramount at the time and the experience with Ghost was AMAZING. See, the two big movies for summer 1990 were Another 48 Hours and Days of Thunder. Those got all the hype, big marketing, the big May and June summer release dates. They both came out and did…okay. They were both very generic summer movies. Very mediocre box office and it looked like a really shitty summer for Paramount.

No one knew anything about Ghost. We saw a very early screening where the background music wasn’t in yet, and the effects for the creatures dragging bad people to hell were badly drawn placeholders. I don’t know if they still do this…probably send out screener dvds or have you log into a special streaming website now…but back then we had screenings for exhibitors to get them hyped about a movie, get them to do a longer contract. For the big summer releases you could say “untitled Tom Cruise movie” and get the exhibitors to do a 12 week contract, but you had to sell the smaller ones, and the exhibitors had a lot more power.

I only worked for Paramount for a year, across two summers, and I’d been through the exhibitor screening thing the previous year with Let it Ride, which was the late summer release that year, so I saw and felt the atmosphere at the exhibitor screening when everyone knew it was a loser. I’d also been to the local Atlanta press screenings for Another 48 and Days, which had similar disappointing energy. 

The exhibitor screening for Ghost was totally different. Exhibitors would bring family members or friends who were in the target audience and watch them watch the movie, and Ghost grabbed all of us from the jump. We knew nothing going in, I don’t even think there had been a trailer yet. This was in late May and the movie was due in mid July, and the music and effects were not even in. The only music was the iconic song during the pottery scene. I was a 24 year old woman so I was smack in the target audience and I loved it, and I wasn’t the only one. It was the only exhibitor screening I went to where people applauded at the end of the movie.

Then we had sneak previews in multiple locations around Atlanta the week before release and all of us in the office had to go work one showing with our little comment cards and pencils, and watch the movie with the crowd and take notes on reactions. Again, applause at the end, and the comments were all positive.

I can’t even describe how different the energy level was going into work on the Monday after it opened, compared to the Mondays after the two “big” releases. Back then we didn’t have the Thursday night screenings for new releases, and by the time the first screenings were happening Friday afternoons, we were we were leaving for the weekend. Grosses were reported manually on Monday morning, my job was literally to call each chain and all the indie theaters and write down grosses on a big worksheet that got faxed to LA by 11 our time so it was there when the offices opened out there. and there were no instant reports hitting the news by Sunday night. It was all about Monday morning and getting the gross reports together and faxed to LA before 11 AM when the offices there officially opened.

With the first two summer movies, it was gloom and doom on those Mondays. The next Monday would be worse, because the second weekend drop really told the tale. On both those movies the exhibitors were calling in on the second week wanting to shorten the contract or at least dump the prints for multiple screens. The drive ins wanted to start doing double features, which were banned for the first few weeks. It was super busy but all bad news, and no fun at all.

The first Monday after Ghost was so different, and I think it was the biggest hit during the year I worked there, and definitely the only surprise hit which is why it was so much crazy fun that first week. The movie had sold out all weekend and because it had been finalized so late, they hadn’t had enough prints to open on multiple screens in any but the biggest theaters in the city, so everyone was rushing to get another print so they could do more shows. It was the exact opposite of the two big releases. And by Tuesday “Unchained Melody” was getting played on the radio. 

And then the second weekend the grosses barely dropped, partly because they had gotten more prints made so it was on more screens, but it’s mostly because word of mouth was so positive, people were talking it up and going back to see it multiple times. 

Nowadays you can pretty much see the arc of how a release is gaining to go before the movie even opens because so much more insider chat is online where everyone can see it, and the contracts for showings are so much tighter so even if a smaller movie is building an audience, it’s usually gone from the theaters in a week or two no matter what. There really aren’t many surprise or sleeper hits any more.

Paramount had so many disappointing releases during the year I worked there, it was really cool to have had that experience as a contrast. It changed the whole summer—the whole year—for Paramount. That movie ran in theaters right through the rest of the summer and into the fall and didn’t get pushed out of first run theaters til the big Thanksgiving and Christmas releases were coming out, and even then it was still playing in second run dollar theaters right through the Oscar nomination announcements, then it came back to first run for a bit. When they talk about a movie having “legs” at the box office, that’s what they mean, it just kept on going. and it deserved it, it was audience response that did it, not hype. It probably seems cheesy and outdated to people watching it now but it was really different in that moment and it turned out that people were really hungry for a good romantic film with enough mystery/suspense and Demi Moore in tank tops to keep the boyfriends and husbands happy too.

If you read all this, thanks, it was a nice trip down memory lane. I haven’t watched Ghost in years but I kind of want to revisit it now!",katchoo1

I have one and only one rule in this class. I will tolerate no reenacting, whether it’s ironic or sincere, of the Patrick Swayze/Demi Moore scene in Ghost. Ever since that movie was released in 1990, I have seen every conceivable variation of what I call ‘Ghosting’. It’s guy-on-girl, girl-on-guy, the hilarious guy-on-guy...

1gcjljd,"Of the highest grossing domestic movies of the last 40 years, which are the most forgotten?",ltuydeh,2024-10-26 15:04:00,"I'm a huge cinema geek and absolutely adore this movie. Great performances by everyone, Christopher Lloyd deliberately hamming it up and chewing scenery, and some great adult humour along with the kid-friendly stuff. I can revisit this movie any time (and did a couple of weeks ago) and still just enjoy the ever-loving heck out of it.

It's also an amazing time capsule of that transitional period where cel-based animation was pretty much at its peak but literally just a couple of years away from being made utterly irrelevant. And it's fully aware of it too; everyone knew CGI was eventually going to be good enough to supplant cel animation and so this movie was intended as and came off as a love letter to the process knowing full well that it was the only time in history this movie could've been made.

Not to mention, it was Zemeckis using his success with Back to the Future to get someone to write him a blank check for whatever passion project he wanted to make next... and in my opinion he knocked it out of the park. It's also a wonderfully entertaining antidote to today's animated or live action movies that take themselves and their premises far too seriously. This is a rare example of a movie that started with a ridiculous premise of melding traditional cel animation with live action, mixing comedy, drama, social commentary and film noir detective films and creating actual art. 

Today you have people like Coppola putting out movies like Megalopolis and claiming they are the pinnacle of cinematic art... meanwhile in my opinion true cinematic art should be enjoyed and enjoyable for everyone. Roger Rabbit is that movie for me.",Sinister_Crayon

Comparing the Nemo to Dory, or Toy Story 1+2 to 3+4, Monsters Inc to University etc etc the originals are much better paced and written. More quiet moments and sincerity. The sequels add a bit more silliness, are much louder, and feel less substantial. Not bad of course, still enjoyable films, but they definitely feel more hyperactive to me.

I thought it was just me being an old fucker and that 'kids movies' were just too quick for my age-addled brain. But then I went back to Toy Story 1 and was astounded by how good the screenplay is, and how well paced the whole thing is. That scene where Woody is stuck under a crate and Buzz is having an existential crisis absolutely floored me. And scenes like that are a rarity in most modern-ish animated films.

So while Dory has more \*CrAzY\* things happening in it, more characters, etc than its predecessors, I think it's less memorable because it overall feels less substantial.",Cutter9792

Prequel and sequel trilogies were bad . I know plenty of people (fans and non-fans) that enjoyed them. I didn’t. That’s like, my opinion man. 

Solo wasn’t good. 

The shows have been pretty good, though I think I’ve only seen about half of what’s out now. Mandalorian was good, Kenobi was good. Book of Fett got boring and I stopped watching halfway in, which was disappointing. I didn’t bother with anything else that came out. Might be burnout, not sure.

The clone wars series was a fun watch. Nice to see them fix some mistakes the prequels made.

The Avatar movies are all about tech innovation and spectacle. The stories are shallow as hell and/or outright stolen from other movies but that's intentional. It's the reason ""unobtainium"" was used as the name for the mineral from the first movie; it gave a reason for the conflict without having to explain it further than a surface level. I've watched Avatar twice; once on release in IMAX and then again right before the release of the sequel. I've seen Avatar 2 once, and will probably watch it again right before going to see the third one. Beyond that, I NEVER find myself sitting down and thinking ""I'd like to watch Avatar tonight...""

Because that's what the general audience wants. Most people eat the same food from their favorite restaurants, and don't constantly go looking for something 'new'.

>Additionally, it has pushed studios to go for ""blockbuster"" action flicks vs stories told through the characters.

This is also misleading. Blockbusters pay for the ""stories told through the characters"". Big studios aren't choosing between the two, its not one or the other. It wasn't like Fox was like ""we could make Die Hard 4 or Juno or The Darjeeling Limited"", main Fox made Die Hard 4, and it's profits paid for Fox Searchlight to make stuff like Juno and others.",Bomber131313

An entire movie about a cowardly clown fish chasing his son across the ocean while they both learn and grow on their own journey was just such an original and amazing idea that was then executed to perfection. Doing it again but with a different fish doesn't hit the same.

*Inside Out* was the same. The concept of emotions manifesting as little people who don't control our us but still influence our day to day is super fun. Wrapping that up in a journey of personal growth/growing up/letting go of the past and accepting it's OK to be sad made it a very meaningful film. Doing it all over again but now we're a teenager with anxiety and some slightly different personal growth to go through just isn't the same.

*Finding Dory* and *Inside Out 2* were both solid movies and I enjoyed watching them, but they just don't hit the same way as the originals. There's some exceptions, for example I don't think the original *Toy Story* was the best of them, but sequels often struggle to reach the same heights as the originals when the originals are *that* kind of quality.",PineappleOnPizzaWins

I love the trilogy, although there are tons of parts that were unecessary. There's a really good story, but it's just covered with a lot of unecessary crap.

The first is a straight up modern classic. 2 and 3 have so many good elements which outshine the weaker ones. 3 has a number of issues but it has its redeeming qualities. 

I also agree that there is a very interesting story there. We have a main story between 3 protagonists along with a background story about EIC v Pirates which is equally engaging. Not too mention the intriguing subplots involving Davy Jones, Barbossa, Bill Turner etc.

And Davy Jones is indeed a terrific and memorable villain. He has a great arc along with epic ship, theme song, design, and CGI work.

He's fine but not one of the greatest. Also, I think Barbossa in the first movie far out classes Davey Jones in every way. He was still humane in a way and wasn't completely off into the mythical realm of evil like Davey Jones is, but just enough to make for a really fun adventure movie.

I don't wanna detract or put down Bill Nighy at all because he's great, but I think Geoffrey Rush stole every scene he was in in the first movie in a way that Nighy didn't quite achieve.

It's Javier Bardem as an unhinged spanish pirate ghost? Are you kidding me? Depp can phone it in all he wants as long as Salazar gets his time in the spotlight to make up for it.

It's worth noting too that Blackbeard looked awesome (to be fair- it's Ian Mcshane, the man doesn't really have to try to look awesome), but didn't really.....do much. Salazar on the other hand looks menacing as fuck, and personally guts handfuls of men through the movie, leads his men into battle, and is constantly on Jack's tail. ...Except when he buys into Barbossa's bullshit. Thrice. But I'm willing to forgive that because of his awesome introduction. The THUMP of his boots landing on the beat of his theme.. oof.

Both had their great moments though. Blackbeard showing off the control he has over his ship, and his ''I will have one last fight, by God...'' when Barbossa shows up at the end come to mind. Honestly, I'm just a sucker for villains- it's probably why I just enjoy these movies without caring about Depp.

The first movie is the best movie for two very simple reasons.

1) it is its own complete standalone adventure with a beginning middle and end.

2) the character of jack sparrow wasn’t written as Johnny Depp’s insane vision of a pirate. He had normal, albeit funny dialogue and all the affectations came through in the performance.

OST didn’t have to worry about concluding the story ark and the lack of pressure I think helped it be more fun and self contained. I think though the newest one was my least favorite. Depp seemed down and off. At the time I thought it was because he was guilty and felt the mask slipping but now I see the situation with Heard is a lot more nuanced.

I did my bachelor's degree in linguistics( by no means am I an expert, especially in discourse analysis, but have a basic understanding).

The only thing I want to say is that your writing is almost incomprehensible. As a reader I have to do a tremendous amount of work to understand your meaning and keep up with the pace at which you introduce new concepts. You need to define your terms and their relevance in more detail with better examples before launching into using them for analysis.

I don't think you are a moon man, as other commenters are saying. But you should turn your discourse analysis skills to your own writing and focus on how a naive reader will consume the information. 

As one other commenters said, unless you are taking this as an exercise to be applied to the dialogue writing process, you would be better served by analysing real speech samples than written characters. If this is just for fun go for your life, but for it to have practical application it needs to signify something more. 

Something you may find interesting is videos of people with speech aphasia, which show interesting parallels between internal thought processes and speech output.

- *P!nk, Aimee Mann, John Lennon, Noize MC* **+** *Electric Six, Ashbury Heights, Elvis Presley, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, Tears For Fears* **+** *Hurts and Kraftwerk and Phil Collins*

Let's rock!)

**Elizabeth Swann** = may be similar to [P!nk eg So What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJfFZqTlWrQ) or [What About Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClU3fctbGls)
 
**on low level** [P!nk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)) jumps (-) from a thing to a thing or expands (>) information; *on high level* P!nk quickly characterizes the situation (++) or tells standalone facts (.)
 
(-) is a wild card, it means no connection or any connection. (>) means just expanding on the thing you already said.
 
(++) describes something that continuously causes things to happen (benefits/troubles or else), for example a big problem that needs to be solved or a gift that keeps of giving...
 
(.) is a bunch of standalone facts/events that don't need any context to be understood, every bit of (.)-speech is a self-sustained point... you can split such speech into pieces without losing any context...
 
- *I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went* (-)(>) *So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope!)* (-)(>) *I got a brand new attitude and I'm gonna wear it tonight*
 
- *We are searchlights, we can see in the dark* (>) *We are rockets, pointed up at the stars* (>) *We are billions of beautiful hearts* (-)(>) *And you sold us down the river too far*

I appreciate the effort of the reader! But If that's not as hard as coming up with those ideas from the scratch, in a way that's OK

Of course I mean this half-jokingly!) But I am half-serious at the same time (I did the effort too and my understanding is not final and the topic is open for everybody and doesn't require special knowledge)

> You need to define your terms and their relevance in more detail with better examples before launching into using them for analysis.

I have a couple of reasons why I did this/couldn't do otherwise:

- I believe I'm limited in space of the post

- My understanding isn't final, I even change the concepts from time to time. So I just hope the clarity and definitions will come with better understanding

- The difference between some of the concepts is intuitive and meant to be understood in the context of all characters and specific examples of their speech anyway

But there're good news: a kind person agreed to discuss my ideas (help me with the next analysis) and give feedback, so maybe more clarity is coming!

*""parsing out anything beyond 'this sentence reveals character because of X' is going to be a task with an unending list of entries""* 

English is not my native language, I'm sorry: what do you mean?

> As one other commenters said, unless you are taking this as an exercise to be applied to dialogue the writing process, you would be better served by analysing real speech samples than written characters. 

But I'm a very simple person! I don't know how/think I have enough ""resources"" to bring attention to this in legitimate ways, so I'm just making posts on Reddit to make those ideas at least a bit known

For example, I don't know who will care to make enough human tests of the idea ""Humans have speech styles""

I may try to describe your speech pattern, but in a separate answer to not make this one too lengthy",Smack-works
kovtya,Pirates of the Caribbean: speech patterns of 17 pirates,gjax9d9,2021-01-15 02:49:36,"In this post I try to at least approximate your pattern and explain my concepts more properly

In older terms:

**on low level** you jump (-) from a topic to a topic or add (+) on (versions of) topics

*on high level* you describe an event/fact embedded (>>) in a larger context or ""the landscape of the situation"" (==) 

***

Any speech patterns has 2 levels, **low** and *high*. Any level has 2 ""modes"", ""more connected"" and ""less connected"". A ""mode"" corresponds to a concept. (We need 4 concepts for a pattern)

Almost every concept has **low** and *high* level counterparts. For example **""="" Logic/Conditions**

Compare those two messages:

""[I'm afraid of what you'll do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsPSmZ6lVSk) (a) [You've discovered something new And it seems I can't compete](https://youtu.be/QsPSmZ6lVSk?t=94) (b) [I stand my ground but it's effete](https://youtu.be/QsPSmZ6lVSk?t=94) (c)"" 

""*I need my homework done before 12:00 a.m.!* **(a)** *I'm very tired.* **(b)** *And I forgot the material completelly* **(c)**""

The first focuses on a sort of single main condition. Ergo there's logical connection between (a) & (b) & (c).

The second focuses on multiple conditions of some overall situation. There's no logical connection between (a) & (b) & (c).

The first has logic/conditions in the literal content of separate parts of the message, the second has logic/conditions in the implied meaning of the whole message.

The **low** and *high* levels correspond to **literal** and *implied* meaning. Or to **""micro""** and *""macro""* levels. 

We need to learn 6 concepts. By the way, we already learned one of them!)

(=) means focus on a sort of single main condition. (==) means focus on multiple conditions of some overall situation.

I use alphabet letters to separate the utterances like this ""*Blah-blah* **(a)** *blah-blah* **(b)** *blah-blah* **(c)**""

***

What's a ""mode""?

A ""mode"" is one of 2 binary interpretations of 2-3 consecutive utterances, for example:

""*I don't think you are a moon man, as other commenters are saying.* **(a)** *But you should turn your discourse analysis skills to your own writing and focus on how a naive reader will consume the information.* **(b)**""

You can assume that (a) & (b) are strongly connected or that they are not very connected. Each interpretation will be described by its own concept. 

***

A bunch of other concepts I need to describe your pattern:

**""+"" Implications/multiple topics** and **"">"" Context** and **""-"" Random/Coincidence**

(+) means that multiple ""implications"" or sub-topics of/about the same thing are mentioned. (++) means that those implications are focused around a single specific enough condition.

Compare those two quotes: 

""[I think I'm a clone now. There's always two of me just a-hangin' around. And I can stay at home while I'm out of town. Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vFGKHzY_38)""

""[Mother, I can’t drink anymore! Get rid of the drinks! I'm in fear when I see a drink. I cannot support this deception - I can’t drink anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_UqKZJyBK8
)""

The first is more scattered around different conditions, the second is more focused around a some sort of singular main condition (or in the second one ""implications"" are way more equivalent to each other)

(>) is when you just give a (""unexpected"") piece of context. (>>) is when you properly establish some global context.

For example compare ""[Holy water cannot help you now Thousand armies couldn't keep me out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8PU-mTSaI) **(a)** [See, I've come to burn your kingdom down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM8PU-mTSaI) **(b)**"" and ""*I failed again.* **(a)** *All my life is a failure* **(b)**"". The first **(b)** is just a (unexpected) piece of context, but the second establishes some real global context (talks about an event or fact in a larger context)

(-) is a ""wild card"", it means no connection (an abrupt ""jump"") or any connection. (--) means a global coincidence of circumstances or facts and events. I don't have a better description.

""[Took a ride To the end of the line Where no one ever goes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xvn_Ku55cI) **(a)** [Ended up on a broken train With nobody I know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xvn_Ku55cI) **(b)**""

""[They've made mountains out of mole hills Let them climb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7LQ9We7Tyc
) **(a)** [They can chase me to the ends Of the Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7LQ9We7Tyc
) **(b)**""

... I don't have good examples and explanations of them.

***

Now to your pattern:

> *The only thing I want to say is that your writing is almost incomprehensible.* **(a)** *As a reader I have to do a tremendous amount of work to understand your meaning and keep up with the pace at which you introduce new concepts.* **(b)** *You need to define your terms and their relevance in more detail with better examples before launching into using them for analysis.* **(c)**

Do you focus on a sort of single main condition or on multiple conditions of some overall situation? I think it's more of the latter! So one of your concepts is (==)

The ""multiple conditions"" I see in your quote are ""*how clear is the writing? what should the reader do? what should I do?*""

Do you establish some global context? I think yes! So another one of your concepts is (>>)

For example I think **(a)** establishes a greater context for **(b)** and **(c)** or **(a) & (c)** establish context for **(b)**

Are various ""implications""/sub-topics you mention scattered around different conditions or around a single specific enough condition? I think it's more of the former! So another one of your concepts is (+)

I also think you ""jump"" from a topic to a topic (more on that below!) So the last one of your concepts is (-)

Verdict/final description: (of 2 levels of your speech) 

If **(a) & (b) & (c)** are assumed to be ""more connected"" (talking about the same thing) they establish some global context, if **(a) & (b) & (c)**  are assumed to be ""less connected"" (talking about multiple things) they describe different conditions of a global situation

If **(a) & (b) & (c)** are assumed to be ""more connected"" (talking about the same thing) they list multiple ""implications""/sub-topics of/about the same thing, if **(a) & (b) & (c)**  are assumed to be ""less connected"" (talking about multiple things) they are disconnected topics 

So *on high level* you talk about (==) and (>>) and **on low level** you talk about (+) and (-)

***

A music band that I think uses the same pattern in the lyrics:

Depeche Mode e.g. [Precious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yn3ViE6mhY) or [Lilian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYLQwkZ6b4Y)

- *Oh, Lillian I'm a poor man's son* **(a)** *And precious jewels weren't found in schools Where I came from* **(b)**

Is **(a)** the context of **(b)** or are **(a) & (b)** two separate conditions?

Are **(a)** and **(b)** two implications/sub-topics of the same thing or two different topics?

Combine all 4 interpretations and you get the pattern

- *Things get damaged, things get broken* **(a)** *I thought we'd manage* **(b)** *But words left unspoken left us so brittle* **(c)** *There was so little left to give* **(d)**

Is **(a)** the context for **(b) & (c) & (d)** or are **(a) & (b) & (c) & (d)** just listing conditions? 

Are **(a) & (b) & (c) & (d)** implications/sub-topics of/about the same thing or various different topics?

All possible answers combined give the pattern!)

Characters from the media that I think have the same pattern as you: (or similar!)

**Gendo Ikari** from [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendo_Ikari)

- *There are no other people  who can move Eva.* **(a)** *As long as they live, I let them do that.* **(b)** (context or conditions?)

**Ginko** from [Mushishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi) 

- *What a rambling house... and pretty old, too.* **(a)** *I'm surprised Shinra lives alone in a place like this...* **(b)** (context or conditions?)

**Branch** from [Trolls (film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolls_(film))

**Hawkeye** from [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Barton_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe))

**Vasily Borgov** from [The Queen's Gambit (miniseries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(miniseries)#Cast_and_characters)

- *She's like us...* **(a)** *Losing is not an option for her.* **(b)** *Otherwise, what would her life be?* **(c)** (context or conditions?)

**James Bond**, I mean [Daniel Craig's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig#2005%E2%80%93present:_James_Bond_and_worldwide_recognition)

I believe those patterns are thinking patterns, they tell (in an abstract way) on what a band focuses on.
 
You can view those patterns as different ""exposition roles"", each band tells you something about some layer of the situation.
 
You also can try to ""arrange"" those patterns in a single global ""spectrum"":

- *Ashbury Heights < Elvis Presley* **(in the middle)** *< Electric Six < Noize MC and Aimee Mann and Hurts < John Lennon < P!nk and Phil Collins < Kraftwerk < ""Weird Al"" Yankovic*

The farther you go, the more bands focus on a single fact... or the farther you go the more context-independent or conditions-independent or context self-contained or absent of links to outside factors or """"open"""" it gets.

That's just my intuition! (And I don't know how to order some and where to put some)

I think you've basically applied Russian montage to words. Or, likely, someone did this with words before Russian montage existed.

Russian montage, basically championed by Eisenstein in the 1920s, was the idea that you could take two shots, combine them sequentially, and imply a third thing.

A) a shot of a bible

B) a man being shot

they combine in sequence to imply C) that a man is killed in the name of religion.

Now that montage can be quick, or slow. There's the rhythm of it and the concept.

With your analysis of language here, we have

A) We are on an island.

B) We can't find the rum.

C) Somebody is stealing our food.

A+B+C describe the ""high level"" situation, or the *concept* of the montage I just compared this to. Or, one might label it the ""macro"" level, same thing. Grand concepts or nitty gritty.

What I find interesting about this, and of your previous posts (which I didn't get this involved in), is that it speaks to the sociology of what audiences want. You can see all the users her dogpiling and shitting on your efforts, but you're peeling back the orange and seeing its clockwork. This leads to investigations of *what kinds of dialogue are the most successful/accessible with audiences?* or even analysis of what makes a ""major"" character. I'll bet that if you parse it all out you'll find Jack has very different forms of speech than Elizabeth partly because he's allowed to share his thoughts and opinions on situations more than Elizabeth is, the movie leans on him for entertainment more, whereas other characters are mostly there just to move the plot along with dialogue. *Omg Elizabeth, are you serious you want to go find the X amulet and marry Y?* Etc etc.

I think you are 100% right, you can compare ""low level"" with content of actual shots and ""high level"" with the implied meaning.

And ""micro level/macro level"" analogy fits here too, I think about this in such terms already. (see my analogy with the river)

You also can compare low/high level with something ""before the fact"" and ""after the fact"" (what you see while you're getting the message and what you see after you got the whole message). But that's basically the same as your [""Russian montage""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory) analogy.

I think in general speech patterns are equal, but I think it doesn't contradict your ideas and notions, in a specific case you very well can think how a particular speech style can give a character an ""edge"" in expressing thoughts and opinions (I like your notion about Jack very much!) **[see]**

He worked in it. When he shot the film, it was after months of prep work with the VFX team, and while he was shooting he was still working with them and giving them all the material they needed - reference, lighting keys, lighting reference, clean plates, clean motion capture. He also worked with them closely in post as well. 

There was no “we’ll fix it in post” and slamming a ton of problems down on the desk of the VFX team at the end. Gore was very supportive and kept VFX a focus, not as a final pass to be done.

As a human it's harder for us to see the flaws in such movement and look of an octopus.  A real human face is more complex and much harder because we as a human can recognize the flaws even with very good cgi.  Thanos doesn't look  real because they didn't put much effort into his face since it got 10x more SFX workload for them to work on compare to Pirates.

I disagree with you on Thanos, but not strongly enough to actually argue it lol but I think one of the reasons Davy Jones does look so good is because they knew their limitations and didn't shoot him in a way that would make it look worse. You hardly ever see him in broad daylight, the camera works around him so you see him from the most optimal angles, he also doesn't have that much actual screen time so his presence feels more impactful. 

But at the same time a lot of the reason cgi often doesn't look great in movies isn't a technological problem or an artistic problem. It's just a lot of times FX studios and CGI companies are underfunded and are tasked with making a lot of last minute changes. Like for an example Black Panther looks kinda off in Captain America Civil War because the studio got tasked with replacing the physical suit with CGI at the last minute.

On the scale of CGI, it was certainly one of the better examples, but it never looked like anything other than CGI.

For Davy Jones, the skin texture did not need to look human. He is alien enough so that we would not be surprised at his skin behaving differently than ours. I just watched a few clips, and I feel like his mouth movement is not perfect. We might also be distracted by the tentacle movement.

Of course, all those details are really small and this is an amazing achievement that completely works even 15 years later.

The movies listed above, Ex Machina and Blade Runner, while they look very good, they were also very limited in scope and what work needed to be done, and 2049 was chock-full of practical work for a lot of it with CG coats of paint.

Gore Verbinski (dir. PotC 1 - 3) had a background in vfx and worked closely with them to make the deatails just right. They also used lots of practical effects, some of which was used as reference to make the CG look better. Especially for lighting and physics, which I think are the two biggest giveaways in poor cg effects. I remember a behind the scenes clip where they had an actual ship where they droppen two blue 'tentacles' on (plus explosoves for flair) for the kraken attack in Dead man's Chest. This makes the scene look more real because it actually is. For Marvel I often feel they have no real reference and lots of greenscreen with general lighting to be fixed in post.

Even now I think Jones looks much better than Thanos. I sometimes forget Jones is CG, but Thanos always feels fake to me. I don't know exactly why, maybe it's the animated performance of Nighy that makes Jones more real, whilst the quite neutral performance for Thanos that undoes him. Maybe it's the physics and the whole CG environments that take me out, for PotC they used big sets for the ships with rain and water to add to the realness of it all.",Mordarch

POTC has always been focused on looking grimy, dirty, rotting and distressed.
