Now keep in mind that the big three, they‚Äôre like royalty, cooled trailers, serving staff. But people like her, even if she had lines of dialogue are just basically chattel and pieces to move around a board.

It was originally cursed for Cortez, as he killed the Aztecs for it, but the heathen gods cursed the gold so that ""For every piece taken, it must be put back and the blood of each person who took it, must be spilled. (Essentially saying, bring back the gold piece you touched, put your blood on it, then the curse is lifted upon you)

However, Barbossa's crew did not know of the curse until it was long too late. They had spent almost all of it, and now had to scrounge up every last piece. Bootstrap Bill Turner, however was feeling remorseful. He hated being apart of the mutiny on Jack so he mailed the piece to his son, Will, in London.

It wasn't until Bootstrap complained about the mutiny that Barbossa had his bootstraps mounted upon a cannon, and they blew him away onto the ocean floor. But then another problem arose, they could not reverse the curse becuase Bootstrap's golden piece was gone and even if they found it, they had to way to get his blood to repay it. So they searched for the golden piece (now turned into a Medallion and at the same time, searched for Will Turner)

TL;DR Becuase Barbossa had Boostrap killed, his blood needed to reverse the curse, had to come in form of his next of kin, being Will as Bootstrap's blood flows through his veins.",ARubyHeart

The Aztec gold that Barbossa's crew (which used to be Jack's crew but they mutinied) stole from the Isla de Muerta was cursed. Each person who took any gold, even a single piece, from the chest was cursed. To break the curse, they needed to return all the gold to the chest, along with blood from all the men who took the gold. The problem was that shortly after they took the gold and were cursed (presumably before they realised that they were cursed), Bootstrap Bill spoke up about feeling bad for what they did to Jack so as punishment he was strapped to a cannon (by his bootstraps) and thrown overboard to drown. Thus, by the time the pirates realised that they were cursed and learned how to break it, it was too late to retrieve Bootstrap Bill's blood, as he was on the ocean floor somewhere, strapped to a cannon (they had no way of knowing he'd joined Davy Jones at thus point). Since they couldn't get the blood from Bill himself, they had to look to the next best thing - the child who carried Bill's blood in his veins. This child is Will.",TubbyLittleTeaWitch

They didn‚Äôt specifically need Will‚Äôs blood. They specifically needed Will‚Äôs father‚Äôs blood. But they couldn‚Äôt get that because Bootstrap was at the bottom of the ocean.

Still, they had to do *something.* They were cursed and desperate, and they weren‚Äôt about to sit down and accept their fate. So they came up with the idea to go after Bootstrap‚Äôs child, Will.

Because Will was related to his father ‚Äúby blood,‚Äù he effectively had his father‚Äôs blood running through his veins. But he also had his mother‚Äôs blood, which is why one of the pirates says, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs only half Turner,‚Äù and suggests they spill all his blood to be safe. So even *they* weren‚Äôt positive Will‚Äôs blood would work.

And if it *hadn‚Äôt* worked, they probably would‚Äôve hunted down every member of the Turner family and hoped that if they got enough volume of diluted blood, it would eventually count. Or they may have searched the sea floor high and low for Bootstrap himself, and failing that, they may have tried to go to Davy Jones‚Äô locker to retrieve him.

The point is that they had to try *something.* Since they didn‚Äôt have access to blood that was 100% Bootstrap‚Äôs, the plan they came up with was to go for blood that was 50% Bootstrap‚Äôs. Lucky for them, it worked.",SeaSchell14

Bootstrap didn't die, but they tied a cannonball to his feet and sunk him to the bottom of the sea so they couldn't reach him.

Bill Turner even said so in movie two ""I couldn't move, I couldn't die. I knew if there was a chance to change my fate I would"" that's why he joined Davy Jones, because he was trapped at the bottom of the ocean with no chance of escape, not even death, because of the curse.

At World's End is great too, it's just that I don't like it as much compared to DMC, I dunno why, though, it's probably cause of the cluttered story and the overall tone of the movie being, I dunno, ""everything's gone to heck"".

On Stranger Tides is meh (in an ok way).

Dead Men Tell No Tales is one of my personal favorites, it was my first Pirates movie, pretty ironic, huh? The last movie being my first. I feel like DMTNT was a great send off to the series, being one last fun adventure before Jack sails into the distance as Will and Elizabeth reunite. DMTNT was my dream Pirates movie, and I'll never stop loving it.

I'd say that OST and DMTNT were the films that felt like og Pirates the most, being one-shot adventures full of action and pirate-ry.

As the films progressed, the unspoken theme of what it means to be a ""Pirate"" is conveyed so eloquently almost non-verbally, for example whenever characters betray each other, everybody just shrugs it off saying, ""Pirate!"". Initially, I used to think by 'Pirates' they only meant Jack, Barbosa, Davy Jones and their respective crews. But as the story progressed, you realize Will, Elizabeth, Norrington, Beckett, Tia Dalma, Governor Swann, they all give in to the true nature of being a pirate, as they lie, cheat and betray others to get what they want.",thenightmarefactory

You can kind of imagine the film as a hidden chapter in human history, whereas its sequels open their fantastical gates so open that the same almost becomes impossible.

And whilst I enjoy a good humorous Jack moment, I do love how the character is written. There is a slight seriousness and ferocity behind him. He's not necessarily all-good even though he can be considered a good person amongst thieving pirates. The whole ""I can let you drown"" speech to Will can be perceived as fully believable action on behalf of the character, whereas in the sequels the character is much more reigned in on being ""good and silly"" that the serious side of Jack pales in comparison.

Jack may be a trickster, but he‚Äôs got unfinished business with the Black Pearl‚Äôs crew, which makes him‚Äîat least temporarily‚Äîa convenient ally.

Letting Jack enter the cave might be Norrington‚Äôs way of drawing the pirates out without tipping them off. He also expects they‚Äôll need boats to get back to the Pearl, so setting up an ambush at sea seems reasonable enough. Yes, it‚Äôs risky, but it might be his best option for maintaining some control. He doesn‚Äôt want to endanger Will with a head-on assault, and he can‚Äôt simply give Jack free rein. Plus, he‚Äôd like to minimize losses among his men, which makes a more cautious approach preferable to a direct attack.

He‚Äôs well aware that Jack is unreliable and anticipates a potential betrayal‚Äîhence leaving guards on the Dauntless and waiting nearby with his crew. However, he may not have realized just how adept Jack is at playing both sides. Jack manipulates the Navy, gains favor with Barbossa‚Äôs crew, and chases his own goal of reclaiming the Black Pearl.

What really trips up Norrington is that Jack is juggling multiple agendas, and the pirates are cursed‚Äîtwo factors he could never have foreseen. His plan, while it seems logical based on what he believes he‚Äôs facing, ends up failing. I wouldn‚Äôt call it a full plot hole; the movie simply doesn‚Äôt dwell on a detailed breakdown of his tactics. It provides the key points, but Pirates of the Caribbean is, at heart, an adventure-comedy, so certain military details take a back seat in favor of pacing and humor.

In my view, the real issue isn‚Äôt the lack of explanation. The film strikes a lighthearted tone, with comedic moments‚Äîespecially those involving Ragetti, Pintel, Mullroy, and Murtogg‚Äîthat can overshadow Norrington‚Äôs competence, making him look more inept than he truly is. I actually find those gags funny and well-done; for me, it‚Äôs more about how they‚Äôre inserted, rather than the comedy itself. I totally understand if others aren‚Äôt bothered by this at all‚Äîpersonally, it just nudges me out of the story a bit after multiple rewatches, even though I still love the film overall.

I truly think POTC owes its legacy to Johnny Depp and Captain Jack. All of the Jack-isms that Johnny brought made the character stand out and become very memorable and made Pirates stand out. I think Disney might have stopped after the first film cause I just don't see it being as popular without something/someone so iconic and different for the time.

People would still remember it just as fondly, only people would associate *PotC* with Barbossa instead of Jack. Geoffrey Rush's performance of Barbossa has just as much of an exaggerated flourish as Jack, especially since Jack only really went completely off the rails in movie 2. I could definitely see Jack's role as mentor being played by an older actor, and Will being the main character. After the enormous success of Lord of the Rings, I think Orlando Bloom would definitely be considered a big enough actor to lead the franchise. It also makes the twist at the end of movie 2 more intense: without Jack to occupy the middle ground between ""vile pirate"" and ""respectable englishman"", the dynamic between Will + Elizebeth and Barbossa is much higher-contrast.",

But to answer the question, the entire battle of Isla de Muerta is definitely among my favorite just from the behind the scenes makings alone.

But I can remember being told 20 year ago about 2 months before the premiere by a CM at Disneyland Paris in the queue for the ride that there was a film coming out about the ride. This was our second ride we had been on (we did Peter pans flight before hand) and I remember 7 year old me loving the ride and it being my top ride at DL Paris.
When we got home after the holiday, posters where going up and the news about the film was starting to circulate. I think if my mind is correct that the premiere was filmed and broadcasted live in Europe meaning that I was allowed to watch it. I am about 10 years younger that what Keira was and I remember being obsessed with her acting.
Seeing the film in the cinema for the first time was magical, they really did do the ride justice and I‚Äôm a little bias by saying that Paris POTC ride is still the best.

Though I have heard a theory that an apple often represents temptation given that people usually portray the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eden story as an apple, and thus maybe it was used here as a sort of metaphor of an ultimate temptation where Barbossa could physically have it but literally could not eat it.

Frankly it‚Äôs my favorite movie of all time. So I was sad to hear that only certain movies ever get rereleased to theaters, and this didn‚Äôt seem like one of them. So it‚Äôs always been on a bucket list of mine to see it in theaters again

During 2021, for my birthday my wife surprised me by renting out a theater and having us watch this in theaters again, and crossing something seemingly impossible or at least far fetched is a very cathartic experience and I recommend it highly 

All this to say I am amused that oh by the way here it is in theaters again.

Which is also crazy that out of ALLLLLL the amazing classic Disney movies they could‚Äôve thrown into the 8 they‚Äôre rereleasing, this one is one of them. This movie that I see on every goodwill dvd shelf for some reason",

Will is just a man who would do the right thing no matter what the rules say. Piracy is in his blood and having spent time with Jack as well as seeing how Jack helped get Elizabeth back, his feelings towards Jack feel earned.

I take your point about not being spoonfed, that is nice. And I agree the sequels got really messy. I think the tangle of motivations and betrayals runs out of steam well before the film ends. The filmmakers also leave a fair bit of catharsis on the table. They could have really showcased Will's transformation into a more anarchic but still noble character, and it would have been vicariously exciting. All the cutting away from him, time spent ogling Jack Sparrow, etc., seemed to take away from that.

Will and Norrington know Elizabeth has been kidnapped by the Pirates. What they did not know is they would only cut her hand and leave her be then. What do you assume of murderous pirates if they kidnap one who is dear to you? Of course you assume the worst. And suppose if they had only cut her hand, regained their mortality, do you think the pirates would have spared a beautiful girl like Elizabeth all alone in a cave cut off from the world?

Right in sight of all the Pirates so that they could kill him the next moment?

I doubt the heroes would have been free. The pirates would not have spared them. Plus, the Pearl would have remained in Barbossa's control meaning their piracy would have continued for long. It was necessary for the navy to be there and only then could the Pirate threat have been ended.",Boss452

Well, there isn't much shifting around here as in 3 but it does start to work here. I think since they are all pirates, it makes sene and keeps the plot interesting.

> Very interesting question about the film's score. It's such a huge character in the film, I think the film would be a less enjoyable experience without it. So I think it would have been less good. What do you reckon?

Yeah, the score is indeed very itnegral to the movie. I think the film would lose some gravitas and epicness without it.

But I couldn't quantify how much less money (if any) it would have made with a generic score. -5%? -10%? 

We saw with the first couple of MCU phases that a franchise doesn't NEED a distinctive soundscape to be successful. But I think it probably helps something feel more like an event if it has one.

I.e., if the first-weekend crowd loves the movie, the movie gets better word of mouth and more repeat viewings, aka is a bigger hit. I think score goes some of the way towards making people good about recommending a movie, or seeing it twice, whether consciously or otherwise.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1ca98,2017-10-29 03:54:00,"One of the scenes I wish they kept in the series. The scene when Bekkit and Sparrow are making arrangements, and he says ""We had a deal, Jack."" It's obvious they go way back, but nobody knows why. 

The original scene was too harsh for most children. It went soenthing like this:
""We had a contract, Jack. I hired you to deliver cargo on my behalf, and instead, you chose to liberate it.""
""People aren't cargo, mate.""


Jack had freed the slaves he was supposed to deliver, so Bekkit tracked him down and burned his ship and branded him. He had a debt if 100 souls to Davy Jones to raise the still-charred (and therefore black) ship from the ocean, in exchange for 100 souls in the future. 

I recommend you watch the scenes. You gain a a lot more respect for Jack, and it explains the entire history between Jack and him. Just stop one sentence added so much that for me into the entire series, I really wish they kept it in.",pilotavery

Genuinely fun, fantastic cast chemistry, a supporting performance from Depp that felt so revolutionary at the time.

It's such a shame both franchises have been somewhat tainted with their successive terrible, soulless, cash-grubbing sequels.
Pirates in particular suffered from the studio plucking that great supporting performance in Jack Sparrow and trying to force him into a central role, without understanding that the reason he was so great was because of what a perfect storm the relation between each character was in the first one. Shifting the dynamic ruined everything.

The script for Pirates 1 is a masterpiece in adventure storytelling. Everything you could want to see in a Treasure Island era Pirate movie, this has.  Ship to ship battles, walking the plank, curses, and buried treasure.  And I love that the treasure was found BEFORE the movie and now it's about getting it back.

Another thing that doesn't get enough credit is how good a guy Norrington is. It would be so easy to have a scene where he says to a confidant, ""once I marry the Governor's daughter, I will be the most powerful man in Port Royal.""  But NO. He's a decent, respectable man who really cares for Elizabeth.  He loves her and he wants the best for her but if she chooses Will, he won't put up a fight.

I watched it nightly for a few weeks. It was interesting though, because I missed tons of shit in my first few viewings and the plot became much clearer to me on repeated viewing. 

For instance, I didn't originally catch that Jack was never cursed, he just curses himself at the very end with the coins, so that he can battle the pirates without worrying about dying. To take such a huge risk with his own mortality and getting all the coins back in time, awesome moment. 

It's funny that pirate movies didn't become the new trend the way superhero movies did. I wonder who else would've made a good pirate. ",

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1o5tv,2017-10-29 12:33:30,"Black Pearl is probably the only movie where the trailer entirely changed my preconceived opinion. Keep in mind, Disney previous movie had been the Country Bear Jamboree. But Black Pearl stands on its own by reversing tropes and avoiding cliches. The writing is great.

In particular, in the supporting roles, Jack Davenport's Commodore could have easily become a bad guy or used the pirates to get rid of Orlando Bloom, but he was true to his character who was honorable but had one weakness, though not a fatal one. The two goofy sailors who were comic relief might be expected to jump in the water and flee in terror at the end, but instead they see what's going on and charge into battle. And I don't think anyone but Geoffrey Rush (okay, major character, not supporting) could've delivered that line about eating a plate of apples and sounded sincere -- it sounds like something that might've been said in a 1950s Disney film, but it works. You can believe he'd want to taste apples first before going back to, say, ravishing the beautiful woman in front of him.

I loved the first three, and in my opinion, they ought to have stopped. But of course, $$$$. The general consensus in Hollywood is, ""milk it to death"". 

Pirates 4 was alright. 5 was, ok. (Took me several attempts to complete 4). The last installment, however, can be found wanting. Wanting of that last lil bit money that movie goers are willing to shell out for a ship that's been sinking for several years. 

The series started out as a story of a ghost ship that's unsinkable. Seems that pirates is a series that also just won't sink.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp18mp0,2017-10-29 02:22:08,"I absolutely loved Curse of the Black Pearl. 

The other films in the series have ranged from ‚Äúokay‚Äù to ‚Äúehh,‚Äù which is really too bad. The most recent film (Dead Man‚Äôs Chest) comes perhaps the closest to recreating the magic of Curse of the Black Pearl, but even that movie is weighed down by the somewhat forced inclusion of Will and Elizabeth Turner (and on that note, WTF were they thinking bringing back those characters and only having them in the movie for five minutes) and other references to the past few films.

I‚Äôve thought a lot about why Curse of the Black Pearl works so well when the others just don‚Äôt come anywhere close, and I think part of it is because the first film was never originally planned to be a franchise starter; it was a standalone summer popcorn flick, and honestly it was pretty much a master class on how to make that type of movie. When the creators decided to add lots of weighty lore and build a big, epic universe, they immediately lost some of that sense of a light, breezy, easy to follow storyline.

This is why Dead Man‚Äôs Chest came closest to recreating the franchise‚Äôs original glory, too: it was mostly a standalone adventure with a ‚Äúbig bad‚Äù who could be effectively introduced and dispatched in one film. The story mostly stands on its own, although not to the same extent as Curse of the Black Pearl.

TL;DR: standalone Pirates storylines seem to be much better than attempts at making a trilogy or similarly attempting to draw out the story over several films.",FoorumanReturns

If you have a strong grasp of his work/accent/voice, take a minute to recreate some of Will Turner's lines, but with Heath Ledger in the role.

The movie is already amazing. It doesn't NEED Ledger as Turner. But it would have strengthened what I felt was the weakest link in the movie.  But at least even the weakest link in this was pretty dang strong in this case.",mallad

I have a thing for pirates and this movie is so much fun. As you mentioned Kiera is so damn gorgeous and I could watch a 3 hour movie of just her doing random things. Depp played his role with so much charisma and hilarity and Bloom and Rush as well. The thing that gets me is besides the cast and production values, the story was actually entertaining. It's a story I found myself caught in with just enough mystery until the end to keep you in suspense but enough revealed throughout the movie that you weren't left waiting on the next big reveal. And even though they didn't quite hold up, the next 2 movies were still fun. The waterwheel sword fight from #2 and the naval battle in the whirlpool in #3 are both amazing pieces of art, along with the cgi of Davy Jone's face and the rest of his fishy crew",axechamp75

They should have cut an action scene from the overlong development section of the film and added a plausible action scene that allowed Jack to escape.

My personal series ratings:

CotBP: 9.5/10 - Everything was amazing about this film.

DMC: 9.0/10 - Davy Jones was a great villian, CGI was amazing & still holds up really well, great action & spectacle.

AWE: 8.0/10 - Weakest of the Original Trilogy but plenty of spectacle.

OST: 6.0/10 - Not a ton of action, they utterly ruined Black Beards character & made him weak, film was sorely missing Will & Elizabeth, Barbosa's side-plot & Mermaid scenes/mythology were awesome though.

DMTNT: 7.5/10 - Better than OST, but not by too much. New characters were cool, but NOT Will & Elizabeth cool, Jack unforunately was so out of character & drunk 3/4 of the film & not his clever/intelligent normal self like he usually is, Salazar not memorable enough of a villian like Hector or Davy Jones.",

There are very few outlandish fantasy locations like in all the sequels, and most of it takea place in Port Royal, which is a huge set, or on the many ships, that they all built and sent to sea to film on.

The action itself is also incredibly hand-made. The Ghost Pirates are (very good) CGI, but almost all other set pieces, fights and action sequences are practical / stunt work.

Obviously tweaked a little bit here and there, but that theme absolutely originated when he composed the score for Gladiator. God, I love Zimmer. 

Edit: apparently I have been terribly misinformed for over a decade. Apologies to Klaus Bedelt. So...he borrowed from Zimmer then. Not to condemn him for that, the music is still spectacular and composers borrow from each other and themselves all the time. Zimmer is still king in my book though. ",hvonm86

The sequels pretty much just relied on him (well, the third movie didn't even have him for like the first 30 minutes right?). Jack Sparrow was great, but once you overdo it it becomes annoying.

It's like Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is barely in it (though TBF I do think he could've had a few more scenes), but in Hannibal he's the star and some of the mystique is gone. Another example is the Hulk. In The Avengers he doesn't even appear til the halfway mark and then doesn't appear again til the climax.

There are some cases where movies don't ""age well"" but it tends to be a matter of cultural references degrading or the fact that they weren't exactly revered at the time - exploitation films can be popular, but very rarely break out into any critical acclaim. So I guess ""popular"" movie is more likely to have this concept make sense than ""good"" movie.

The only example of a good movie that I feel like this applies to off the top of my head is *Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?* It was a very progressive and important movie on its release. Today, it has excellent performances and some interesting camera work, but the debates seem overwrought and completely backwards (there's a line that says something like, ""Any fool can see what the *problems* are with interracial marriage, but [supports interracial marriage].""  When you watch it today, you're like: really, are those ""problems"" so obvious?

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1k8fm,2017-10-29 09:20:06,"The other things the other movies dropped: The atmosphere and the fights.

The other movies were far too somber and serious *from the get go*, which cost the later comedy its impact.

And the fights? They're just fights. The first movie took the classic Jackie Chan/Indiana Jones approach, where there's a bunch of shots that first establish the chekovs armory that's about to be fired off in clever ways. For example, think of the Flying Wing fight from *Raiders of the Lost Ark* and how the very first shot of the scene, when the music starts, *frames everything that will be used in the fight*, from the plane to the fuel truck. The mind ""sees"" this and starts thinking.

The fights in the first *Pirates* movie were the same, like the duel in the smithy: Lots of shots *showing* the audience everything, and then the characters use them in clever ways 

Later movies, however, just went right to the fight. There was rarely that moment of ""oh, they just used that to ... WHOA!"". Just ""Hey, now this is happening.""",vikingzx

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1fetk,2017-10-29 05:34:16,"And I think that‚Äôs pretty emblematic of the series as a whole, at least for me and (what I perceive to be) it‚Äôs target demographic. I was in early high schools when the first one came out and it was, and had been, a highly influential movie in my cinematographic education. Black Pearl was a summer blockbuster masterpiece akin to The Avengers and The Dark Knight (as far as pop culture reach goes). To this day my friends and I still quote it and when I was i college I formulated an entire drinking event around it. 

Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End Tried to be something else and, while the result wasn‚Äôt as timeless and endearing as the first, I thought they did a lot to do it extend the lore of the world and develop the core characters. And you are kidding yourself if you say they didn‚Äôt have memorable moments and epic fucking scores. 

For the generation that Black Pearl was introduced to as a target demographic, they were perfectly sufficient, if not great. 

When it came to Stranger Tides, the original target demo of the OT had gotten a little older. With the rise of VOD services like Netflix, capturing them became a lot harder. So pirates 4 had to be as fresh and eccentric as Black Pearl or it wouldn‚Äôt strike such a note... and making jack the central character was not about to make a better movie, so it was by far an inferior work. None of my friends, who were crazy about Black Pearl were excited or impressed by Stranger Tides. 

It wasn‚Äôt garbage - it was fine. But compared to its predecessors, it missed the mark on almost every beat. 

When it came time for #5 the sentiment was like ‚Äúreally? Another one?‚Äù Which is bad for everybody. And not a single person I know, including all those that have seen Black Pearl a million times (including myself), went to see it. 

What it should have been was a Force-Awakens-style reboot. Not a cash-in romp with all familiar players, but a totally independent story that brought the world and lore to a new generation with new characters and small call backs to the older films. And when the third act was coming to a close, it brought jack sparrow back for one scene to tease the extended universe. To tie old and new together. 

I know it never could have happened because Depp was and is the most bankable part of the franchise but if the studio had planned for the long run, I think that would have been the right move. And it would have given the series longevity. 

Just my 2 cents. ",suburban_illuminato

But then bring it back. Have him mentor Henry like he mentored Will. Have Barbossa remind Jack of who they were, who they are, and who they can be.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp15dvl,2017-10-29 01:06:22,"I'm not convinced Star Wars was ever that good.  I like the idea of Star Wars very much, and The Empire Strikes Back is great, but it would take a hell of a lot of convincing to make me watch A New Hope nowadays.  Not because I think it's terrible - it's absolutely not - but it's hardly riveting viewing.

I think Star Wars is just one of those things whose lightning-in-a-bottle character was just so gigantic that it becomes impossible to have any kind of a reasonable discussion about it.  I mean, it's 40 years later and you still can't really say the first two were shitty movies without being dismissed as a contrarian.  **40 years**, and still no-one's really 'allowed' to not like it for perfectly rational reasons.

If you want a more recent example, look at Harry Potter.  There is absolutely nothing especially remarkable about Harry Potter, other than it was a fun children's adventure story that a bunch of people read at the perfect age to read that kind of story, but it's been 20 years since the first book came out and it still has an utterly massive following.  I'm not criticizing Harry Potter here, just saying that it's a pretty standard adventure story with nothing that really sets it apart from any other fantasy, and yet here we are 20 years later and it's still untouchable among most under 40.

Star Wars is kind of like that.  In a way, it doesn't even matter if it's any good or not - all that matters is that a gajillion people experienced it at the perfect age to think fondly of it forever.",

What isn't explained is how the characters are wearing wildly anachronistic clothing, disregarding any form of insignia on that clothing, and using firearms that hadn't been developed yet. 

Everyone is jumping down my throats about this but the fact remains that aside from the zombies the rest is supposed to take place in the circa 1720s British West Indies, the golden age of piracy. So there are certain things that should be there and certain things that shouldn't. It's not that hard. ",

I wasn't offended, i just disagreed. I don't think you need to be offended to have an opinion about a public figure known for her beauty.

I don't think it is weird at all. Is it weird to comment on the attractiveness of popular actors?

Personally, my favorite Pirates villain is Lord Beckett, who was an utterly irredeemably, slimy asshole, but it's portrayed so deliciously well by the actor that I can't not enjoy every scene he's in. That, combined with the fact that he had Norrington, who was sort of wobbly on whether he was good or not, and Jones, who certainly wasn't a nice person but at least had understandable motives, serving as foil, and I think it works out fine.

The problem is when you try to go too far in either direction. Salazar was just vengeful and evil, with really nobody else to balance him out, and Fountain of Youth's situation is so complicated with Blackbeard and that Spanish guy that you can barely even tell who's actually meant to be the villain.",Wolf6120

The Hulk is an interesting character but I don't think he works when he has to put on purple shorts and beat up bad guys and that's what all the Hulk movies seem to devolve into by the end of it.

They need to do what they did with Logan... Give us a dark serious adult rated-R movie. Make it about the battle between Banner and Hulk, not ""Hulk VS the US Government"" or ""Hulk VS Different-colored Hulk""

There's that one line in The Avengers where he says ""I put a gun in my mouth and he spat out the bullet"", take that emotion and run with it. That's when the Hulk is at his best. He's best when he's a tragic character, not an incredible one. That's my opinion anyway, I'm sure plenty of people love the purple shorts.

There's a comic called [""Hulk: The End""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk:_The_End) and though I haven't read it, I think something like that would work best.

He showed up late or not at all to set. I think they may have toned down the stuff for him. Also he's like 53 years old irl. 2nd reason is bad explanation of time passing. Pirates 4 takes place roughly 16 years after pirates 3. Jack was early 30s in pirates 1-3. At this point he lost his pearl again, his crew, his luck was down again, he spent 16 years or less searching for the fountain before Blackbeard forced him to find it and succeeded this time,but he lost his second chance at immortality again (no flying Dutchman  immortality) no fountain and that is destroyed. Pirates 5 is now another 4-6 years later. A crappy ship, his pearl is stuck in a bottle still, he's in his early-mid 50s now, crappy luck that is so bad to the point he betrays his compass freeing Salazaar. He lost his purpose, he wanted to sail the high seas for the rest of his life on his beloved pearl, but he's been stuck in a rut with the smallest of loyal crew.

DMC is a blatant set-up movie, and that, in my opinion, makes it worse.  Literally everything about that movie is great, until you get to act 3 and realize ""Welp, they're setting up a sequel.""  At that point, I'm fully checked out, because the story only matters with regard to how it affects its sequel.  

And the sequel is, almost, objectively bad.  There are scenes which moderately redeem it, but they are few and far between.  And in the interim, you have some really terrible scenes, which border on irredeemable.  

The culmination, and combination, leaves you with a nice, warm, fuzzy feeling, but inevitably wanting far more than the movies delivered.  Its depressing.

Sure, it was very low budget and it‚Äôs a miracle (and Marcia Lucas‚Äô editing) that all the parts came together to make it a workable movie since it had such a troublesome production. The score, the sets, the smart tone transitions all combined to make it a generally enjoyable ride. 
*I* still have fun when I re-watch it, A New Hope is still my favorite SW movie and when I watch it with friends and family some of us still laugh at it and get excited at our favorite parts.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp18tcj,2017-10-29 02:26:33,"> I'm not convinced Star Wars was ever that good.

If there's something I can compare it to, it was along the lines of the ""I went in blind to see the Matrix"" stories that we get on reddit every now and then about how amazing it was to see in its first run in the theaters. Back then, it was insanely special and people were riveted. This has persisted throughout generations as it holds plenty of movie magic, something we rarely see anymore with the reboots upon reboots we get.

As for Harry Potter, the first film was as close to the book as I think they could get away with, and that captured just about everyone that held any interest in watching it. The books are a classic example of an author being able to professionally design and market her universe to a generation. The length, complexity, and drama went from one age group to a very different age group by the end of the last book, the same as Harry grew up, ensuring that most people that started the series would see it to completion.

The technical term of the type of progression would be a [Bildungsroman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman). Few book series have ever correctly captured this in a marketable manner and rode it hard. Disney actually attempted to try this with The Black Cauldron a long time ago using early CGI touchup (taking a huge gamble trying to amaze everyone) and it ended up being a huge flop. It's one of 5 books from The Chronicles of Prydain, a very classic example of bildungsroman. But guess what? The 5 books are still timeless coming-of-age stories, and Disney is still trying to revive the whole 5-part movie idea for Prydain as of only a year ago.

Coming of age stories are hugely marketable if done correctly, as the story doesn't need to fit a classic coming-of-age format to technically follow the same plot devices. Some examples that may or may not fit the typical format: Star Wars, Harry Potter, Spider Man, Shrek, Pirates of the Caribbean, Hunger Games, Toy Story, Men in Black, Back to the Future, Matrix, Lord of the Rings, Blade...more than I'm capable of noticing or remembering.",VulturE

But recently when I watched the first season again, I was struck by how many characters and how many plot points were set up in this first season, some of which still haven't had a pay off. Lore wise, it's the densest season and it's best to be seen on a re-watch. 

When people say a show will get better, they mean that the first few episodes or seasons are shit. But that's definitely not the case for GOT. It's just that having so many characters thrown all at once, cutting between 3-4 different places every episode, all the complicated names and general jargon spoken about the characters throws you off. It's not like, say person of interest, where the first season is genuinely a bad season and not at all representative of the show it becomes. I would not touch that season on a re-watch.

Just like you can't throw in epic CGI action scenes to save a bad movie, you can't blame CGI for a movie being bad.

The Hobbit movies are a great example of this: people love to go on about how the CGI orcs ruined the movie, but the greatest scene in those disastrous movies is with Bilbo and Smaug, who is of course entirely CGI. It's the bloated screenplay, the stupid additions and shoehorned cameos that make those movies bad. I would even say that the White Orc looks great, technically, it's just that his storyline and character design is stupid. 

Conversely, while I personally enjoy the Hitchhiker's movie very much, the popular opinion isn't that favourable. Apparently having amazing animatronic Vogons didn't save that movie, but I'm sure they would have been blamed if they had been CGI.

Shore's score not only evokes the sense of fantasy and adventure required for the LotR movies, they are also extremely complex musically with multiple, intertwined melodies and motifs.  

As for being able to stand on their own merit, I feel that Williams is as good if not better than Zimmer.  Just off the top of my head, the Star Wars Movies alone have The Star Wars theme, Imperial March, Force theme, and Leia's theme.  From just the prequels alone, you span different multiple different styles and emotions.  Then, you add on the music he's done for other movies, from Indiana Jones to Superman to Harry Potter to the Olympic Fanfare (the one with all the brass that plays during NBC broadcasts) and I think it's evident that Williams has incredible depth and range to his music.

If anything, when you look at the complete body of work, Williams is much better at creating music that stands well on its own as it is all he does.  Zimmer builds atmosphere and emotion (BWAAAAAAAAAAAANG).  Williams builds themes that are remembered for generations.",Woolfus

Apparently he showed up late or not at all at times and was drinking a lot. Plus I felt the time skips they did hurt the character as they didn't portray it well enough, Captain Sparrow is in his early to mid 50s by Pirates 5. 16 years happened between Pirates 3-4. He lost his ship/crew again, he failed in finding the fountain of youth for 16 years before he gets roped back into finding it and losing it. Then 4 or so years later for pirates 5 he still couldn't bring back his pearl until Barbossa frees it and he's down on his luck, not to mention all those losses since his glorious heydey in the early movies. If they can show him recovering and becoming the jack Sparrow that he was when he was younger in the 6th movie it would be awesome. I still love all the movies except 5, which I think is ok and love watching them year after year still and listening to the OST. I just hope Johnny Deep recovers from his divorce and straightens up his personal problems. I would love to see more Pirates movies. ",waitingtodiesoon

In Mad Max movies, most of the time, Max is essentially a side character. He's there, he's significant, but the story doesn't revolve around Max's journey, it revolves around someone else. Fury Road is a perfect example - the movie is actually about Furiosa and her journey, and Max is along for the ride.

What if you made a Pirates movie with Jack Sparrow playing that same kind of role? It's not his journey, he's just along for the ride, but he's still playing an important role. Meanwhile, someone else that can be allowed to develop as a character can be the actual lead, while Jack is just having fun and getting drunk along the way.",PlayMp1

After all he went through, can you blame him that he's not the same sure of himself man he was in the first movie. 22 years minimum, maybe longer.

I mean yeah, he's got the Pearl yet he can't use it. After like 15 or whatever  years of that, that's definitely going to affect Jack. And becoming an alcoholic is definitely what Jack Sparrow would do if he became depressed lol. I think what people also forget is in that flashback sequence that is Jack Sparrow in his prime. The writers knew what they were doing, doesn't make it good or bad, but it's not like the writers don't undertstand Jack's character. They do.

This also applies to the plot which is ultimately the middle of the story and not geared to standing alone. I might also comment on how much of the action is concentrated in the first act.

Compare and contrast RotJ. Fortunately is has some of the better acting in the franchise, probably thanks to the director, but as I said this only maxes out at good which isn't that hard to find. Not that Empire is bad movie, far from it, but it is a more regular sort of good. 

Oh yeah and the sort of timeless masterful visuals I've been drooling over... much less prevalent.",SolomonBlack

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1652d,2017-10-29 01:24:15,I saw the first movie as a pretty young kid in the late 90s or early 2000s. It was boring. Just couldn't get into it. Empire and return were amazing to me though. The prequels as they were coming out were also really fun. Because of the rest of the series I went back to the first movie with a new deeper understanding and it became great. I absolutely love it now.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp16d5b,2017-10-29 01:29:44,"Look at the words you're using.  ""A good time"".  ""A fun ride"".  ""A generally enjoyable ride"".  Does that sound like a movie that made the colossal impact on people's lives that Star Wars did?  No, it sounds like a good movie that people enjoy.  There are hundreds of good movies out there in the same spirit as Star Wars, and yet none have amassed the same following.  I'm not saying Star Wars is a bad film series, I'm saying that its impact, for whatever reason, was completely out of proportion to its quality as a movie.  Aside from its special effects, it didn't do anything particularly remarkable, and yet it's a gargantuan film property that people love and cherish.

Same again with Harry Potter.  I've read the books and watched the movies.  I mean no disrespect to fans of the series, but to me there is absolutely nothing unique or special about Harry Potter - it's good, it's fun, it has memorable characters and scenes.  So do a ton of other fantasy books.  So do a ton of other non-fantasy books and films and tv shows and games and operas and plays.  Harry Potter didn't do anything that hasn't been done before.  There's nothing particularly *special* about it, other than the fact that a generation of people got into it in a big way.

This is not to criticize anyone who holds Harry Potter dear, but rather to illustrate that for any point in time, there's going to be a thing that everyone latches onto that isn't groundbreaking, but just happens to capture people's imagination.

The argument I'm making is that there's nothing special about Star Wars, there's nothing special about Harry Potter, and there's nothing special about the Marvel movies: it's just random chance that these good and well-made movies/books became the phenomena that they did.",

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp19a84,2017-10-29 02:37:41,"Well, The Matrix actually informed how I feel about all this.  I completely adored The Matrix when it came out; it absolutely blew my mind.  I dressed like Neo for a month - yes, I was that guy.  I've seen it dozens of times.  As far as I was concerned, film as a medium didn't get any better than The Matrix.

And then about 10 years ago, I started wondering: was The Matrix actually a good movie?  I started seeing younger people online wondering what all the fuss was about.  I refused initially.  No, of course The Matrix is amazing.

But the more I thought about it, the more I couldn't shake the feeling that The Matrix was of its time, and that maybe, just *maybe* I fell in love with it because I was a 14 year old nerd in the 90s to whom cyberpunk, long coats, John Woo guns and hacking seemed like the raddest shit *ever*.

So do I think The Matrix is a good movie?  Yes, it's a good movie.  But is it an all-time classic that all future generations should appreciate simply because I got totally into it when I was a young teenager?  I've come to the conclusion that no, it's not.  Your mileage may vary.",

I'm not saying any of these things are bad: what I'm saying is that we always want to talk about them in terms of their success. Their success overshadows their quality. Star Wars can't just be an okay movie, and Harry Potter can't just be a decent kid's book - people have to justify them *more* than any other properties because they were so monstrously popular.

Do I think Harry Potter is good? Yeah, it's okay. Do I think it's 500 million copies sold with a multibillion dollar film series good? Not really.",
movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp18wpr,2017-10-29 02:28:44,"Perhaps that's the case; I don't know, I'm no expert on the history of fantasy literature.  If I had to guess, I'd say that the success of Harry Potter stemmed from a fantasy story written for children that hit a certain critical mass of popularity to the point where *everyone* had to experience first-hand what all the fuss was about.

See also Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones - mostly watched by people who have never touched a fantasy novel in their lives.  Yet they're hugely popular among non-fantasy fans - why?  Because they were just popular and mainstream enough that non-fantasy fans gave them a shot and found that they were fun and interesting.  There was nothing that differentiated GoT and LotR from any other fantasy story for this majority, other than that they were the first fantasy story they'd ever experienced.  Therefore, it was going to seem particularly magical and special because they'd never seen anything like it.  It could've been anything - they could've made a great, big-budget adaptation of any fantasy novel and it probably would've had the same impact.  It's not about Frodo or Aragorn or Tyrion or Ayra - it's that non-fantasy fans were drawn in by the budget and the hype and found that hey, fantasy isn't just for loveless nerds, it's actually kind of fun and exciting.

Ditto Harry Potter.  If you've never read Roald Dahl, or any English school adventure stories, or Lord of the Rings, *of course* it's going to seem like the most original and exciting thing ever.  It's not going to read like a standard mishmash of British fantasy adventures for children.",

However I still think Zimmer has more range. Just on the fact that he doesn't just write the music, he also does a lot of sound design. IIRC it was in a behind the scenes for The Dark Knight that he was talking about everything they tried to create those really twisted bass sound, trying to strum strings on a double-bass with a wide variety of tools etc... Maybe Williams could do it, but off the top of my head I can't think of anything he did that was particularly experimental.

Everyone isn't sitting around together keeping an eye on the door, most actors on a set are incredibly busy because the second they fall behind they're putting a hundred other people behind too. They're having makeup artists do touchups, reviewing their lines and blocking, and overall preparing for their next scene.

Not only that but film sets are massive labyrinths with people running around like ants between tons of rooms. Ever been in a hospital? It's like that, everyone is busy and there are hallways and rooms leading to and from all kinds of places, most of which only specific crewmembers are familiar with.

How do you keep a cast member secret? You have their makeup done in a side room and you use a secondary door onto the set. From there they just wait for their entrance, it's not like the rest of the actors aren't busy with their scenes. Crews are very good at being discrete as well, since they are always at risk of facing serious repercussions for leaks. 

It's not necessarily common  for aspects of films to be hidden from certain members, but's it's by no means unheard of. Considering it was a DVD special feature it's not like it was broadcasted as you said for marketing either. Mark Hamill not knowing that Vader was his father? Now that was a marketing thing, everyone heard about it. This is more of an easter egg.",Urbanscuba
movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1bvdv,2017-10-29 03:42:14,"Eh, it's easy enough. Crew probably signed an NDA, Rush would've been rushed (heh) through a back entrance to a private dressing room. Stagehands, make-up artists, dressers, we're all professionals. No one's gonna gossip to the cast like a washer woman. Considering the caliber of actor they're working with, they'd probably be tickled pink to surprise the cast with an old friend.

As for the rest, it's about timing. Working animals are under a strict set of day to day rules to make sure they are healthy and happy, which limits the amount of time they spend on set. Thus, the director may film one scene in the morning and something completely different in the afternoon. It's a rarity (and generally remarked on when it occurs) that a film will be shot sequentially.

 And finally, the issue of the other actors. Actors, good ones at least, work for a living. If Zoe had another project going on and was just coming in for a cameo, that's an easy lie to believe. Film the scene in the afternoon after lunch as an improv warm up - ""Zoe will walk down here in a minute, need you all to react to her""

Cue Sir Rush.

The first movie is just wonderful. It's really masterfully done by a lot of perspectives. Then the sequels just get more and more outlandish and ridiculous, and I feel like the writers were being told, ""NO, go *bigger,* go *better*, make these people in fucking AWE constantly!""

Except I wasn't in awe. There are some silly physics in the blacksmith fight scene, but dear Lord the wheel in the jungle in 2 was insane and not in a good way. I didn't even see the point of cannibal island.

I liked it best when you really weren't sure what angle Jack was taking or what kind of man he was, that Elizabeth was a pirate fangirl who had grand ideas with no way to back them up (I'll fight *with the coat of arms over the fireplace*), and that Will was this good naive guy.

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp18057,2017-10-29 02:07:56,"I have to respectfully disagree.  Empire is a complete movie in its own right.  It sets up a sequel, but it doesn't leave characters and plotlines blatantly unfinished at the end of its own stories.

A prime example is the scene on Degobah, when Luke walks into the cave.

>What's in there?

>Only what you take with you.  ...Your weapons; you will not need them.

Culminating in Luke cutting Vader's head off, only to see himself appear behind the mask.

Its a brilliant scene which tells not only the character, but us as an audience, that if Luke continues down this path, he'll become the thing he hates most.  And then the fight, where we see Luke trying hopelessly to fight Vader.  Succumbing to his anger, failing to use that anger with any success, And then realizing that Yoda was right all along.  That he needs more training, more discipline, to overcome the biggest obstacle in his path.

DMC doesn't have anything even remotely resembling these scenes.  Jack, even for as true to his character as it is, is constantly wheeling and dealing.  There's never a sense of the feeling that Jack will have to make a sacrifice, or a change, to escape any sort of fate.  We can already tell he's going to come out unscathed.  He doesn't even regard Davy Jones as a threat.  He plays coy, almost in a knowing way, that tells us as an audience, that he's going to be okay.  It's boring.

And the culmination is everything we expect it to be.  Jack is fine; Will pays the price for Jack's faults, and Jack exits completely unscathed.  Literally.  He loses nothing through the entire two films, and even reclaims things willingly given!

I remember leaving the theater, after ""Hello, beasty..."", saying;

>Not only is Jack totally fine, but he's going to be the hero in the end.  Somehow, he's going to live, get rescued, and save the day.

Empire doesn't give that feeling at all.  Its not until the beginning of Jedi, where you get that feeling.  And, by the way, Jedi opens with Luke, and immediately makes you wonder exactly what he's gone through, and who he is now.  AWE, on the other hand, waits almost 40 minutes to introduce Jack back into the story, leaving no mystery as to his character; he's just Jack.  Maybe a bit crazy and eccentric at this stage, but very obviously still Jack.

Empire is brilliant, for me, because for everything that is left unsaid or unfinished, there's no real indication that those stories will continue.  Maybe Han really is trapped forever.  Maybe Luke really can't defeat Vader.  Maybe the Empire really is an insurmountable force, unstoppable in its goal to achieve universal domination.

DMC gives literally none of that.  At the end, we all know Jack is coming back.  We all know Beckett and Jones are going to lose.  And, maybe, some of that lies in Empire setting up our expectations 30 years ahead of time.  But that doesn't excuse the failings of the movie itself.

In isolation, DMC is a great film.  The action is great, the storytelling is well-founded within its created universe, and the characters are all believable in both their roles and actions.

But in the context of the trilogy, it's a boring, predictable, middle of the road movie, that never makes me believe any outcome but the happiest is even remotely possible.  It serves only as a set-up, a hype movie to drag me back to the theater and watch how this all plays out, even if I already know the outcome.",Yabba_Dabba_Doofus

How about everyone giving up fighting, in between the scenes where Barbossa marries Will and Elisabeth on the ship?

How about Davy Jones suddenly being able to be on land, as long as he stands in a pail of water?  How about the finale, where a chained cannon ball  destroys the main mast of two boats, with the protagonist's ship being pulled out of the whirlpool, while the antagonist's ship is simultaneously sucked in?  How about the terrible scene of Beckett walking down to the main deck, while the stairs literally explode underneath him?

Check that [resume of films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner#Film) with either pretty damn good *or damn amazing* soundtracks. Just some of the best here:

* Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan
* Commando (Kind of a weird calypso-Miami Vice soundtrack but it works!)
* Aliens
* An American Tail
* Willow
* The Land Before Time
* Field of Dreams
* Glory
* The Rocketeer
* The Pagemaster
* Legends of the Fall
* Braveheart (Honestly the soundtrack was better than the movie, not that I dislike the movie)
* Apollo 13
* Jumanji
* Balto
* Titanic
* The Mask of Zorro
* Enemy at the Gates
* Apocalypto

Just scoring movies with classical music was experimental for Williams' time.  Williams is a master at musical story telling, he weaves themes and motifs in a way that augment the story, not just add atmosphere to it.  Zimmer also has the benefit of synthesizers when writing his music.  He can sit at his computer and hear what he is writing.

I frequently study with the LotR soundtrack in the background.  In my opinion, both Williams and Shore have music that stand alone better than Zimmer because they primarily go for thematic pieces, not atmosphere.  William's Superman theme is much more memorable than Zimmer's is to me.  But, yes, finding a ""truth"" in terms of musical taste is not only impossible, it's a waste of time.",Woolfus

He composes with a keyboard and a computer, so he can easily sample himself and modify things to his liking, or copy and paste something he likes already.  These things weren't all that available for earlier composers such as Williams, who still sits down with a pencil and paper to create his pieces (although, for Williams this is probably not a stylistic choice, it's all he's ever known).",Woolfus

movies,79ca6m,The Curse of the Black Pearl still holds up 14 years later,dp1fxnh,2017-10-29 05:54:21,"I actually have a very strong opinion on this matter and would like to add something:

PBMC is through-and-through one of those Adam Sandler's rat pack embezzlement Happy Maddison Sony comedy movies with a laughably obscure and oddly specific premise (like The Waterboy or The Zookeeper). What all of these movies have in common is just how formulaic they are, as well as, subjectively, how unfunny they are (Grown-Ups and Jack & Jill being the most notable examples) according to people who demand a bit more nuance from comedy.

Additionally, and most notably, each of these movies hit practically the same story beats. The main character (Whether it's Sandler or James) will inevitably end up with a far more attractive woman in the end after enduring a love triangle with a jerk male love interest to the woman. There will be poorly written and trite slapstick humor. There will be fat shaming. There will be jokes about minorities. There will be fights with bad CGI animals.

This brings us to Hollywood cynicism. The Sandler & co. saga appeal to the same crowd with each new installment. I'm not going to go after the low hanging fruit and insult the intelligence of those who watch these movies. Even though I said that people who hate these movies demand more nuance, I didn't mean that in a pretentious way. The people who buy tickets to something like ""Blended"" don't have to be dumbasses. They may be drunk people. They may be middle schoolers. Or they may even be a person with a doctorate who just laughs at obvious and dumb jokes. Who knows. The point is, there is nothing wrong with someone for enjoying these movies.

The sinister aspect comes not from those who watch these movies, but from those who make them. It's all fine and good that these movies were, at one point in the last two decades, runaway successes. But this empowers the people behind the films to rehash the same formula each time, endowing little to no faith in originality or comedic risk-taking. Innocent enjoyment of dumb comedies inherently leads to the stifling of creativity.

Therefore the same movies got made time and time again until very recently, always by AS & co. and always by Sony (until Netflix abducted Adam Sandler.) And each time, the enormous budgets are siphoned into the pockets of Adam Sandler's friends (Watch the Red Letter Media review of Jack and Jill to learn more).

This is why the same story beats are utilized whorishly repeatedy.

Now, enter Paul Blart Mall Cop. My thesis is that this movie is absolutely NOT a ""so bad it's good"" movie. Something rises to that title through it's delusional incompetence, a la The Room, or Troll 2. PBMC is created as a comedy to be laughed at by a comedy audience, so its hilarity and enjoyability must come from a source other than incompetence.

PBMC is a movie created with the typical pandering cynicism present in any Happy Maddison movie. What makes it stand out is the strength of its lead, and the shock value of its abhorrently ridiculous premise. The story beats are trite, and it reeks of a ""connect the dots"" formulaic movie. It accomplishes everything it sets out to do as far as being a Happy Maddison movie is concerned.

What makes the film genius is undoubtedly the big man himself. Kevin James's role is, with no exaggeration, transcendental. Through his portrayal of Paul Blart, he not only maneuvers through the events that occur within the film itself, but he also navigates the multiple levels of cynicism involved with the creation of the script. During the scene where he jumps over a wide gap on his segway, for instance, he not only acts in accordance with the bravery and steadfastness of his character, but he also makes the main premise pay off as well.

As I said before, the inane premise of these movies is sort of a ""seed"" which the humor stems from. The significance of PBMC is how well-oiled the premise and the subsequent hi-jinks are, and how satisfying the rube-goldberg machine of hollywood cynicism is when executed in the most beneficial way for Adam Sandler and his friends.

If it's unclear what my point is, let's go back to when Blart jumps over the crevice on his segway. This character beat has the added poignance of the ridiculous premise fully paying off as a legitimate comedic tactic here. That is why PBMC is unintentionally genius, because the superlative of this Happy Maddison formula effectively imparts some degree of meta consequence on the viewer.

To use an analogy, the typical moviegoing experience can be compared to aerobic respiration while the average Happy Maddison film is anaerobic respiration. The former is a healthy exchange while latter resorts to despiration and scraping of the metaphorical bottom of the barrel in order to work. Paul Blart Mall Cop would be analogous to the superhuman ability of breathing without oxygen; anaerobic respiration is theoretically inefficient, but if one were to come across the ability to use it without having to rely on aerobic respiration, it would theoretically be miraculous, liberating, and cathartic, three words I would use to describe Pall Blart Mall Cop.

Furthermore, Paul Blart is a classical tragic hero of sorts. He exists as an avatar within a cess pool of a nameless rabble of morally inferior beings, compounding his trancendental state. Every action or line of dialogue conveyed by him is one of sincerity, and his very livelihood emits a subtext of fatalism (Luke Skywalker, anyone?)

When he is fully immersed in the crime that faces his mall, and it is HIS mall, goddamn it, his attitude is one of resolve and determination. He very closely follows the ""hero's journey."" This allows his character to be one through which the viewers can sympathize.

And this brings me to my third main point, which consolidates the two aforementioned principles. To recap, those are

a) PBMC succumbs to the typical brand of cynicism present within the average Happy Maddison flick, and uses these traits to underscore the progression of our main character, as well as underscore the hilarity of its own completely ridiculous premise

b) Blart is an engaging and poignant character through which the audience can be brought on a journey

My third and final point is that Paul Blart makes the whole experience through the thought process of a hack screenwriter palatable. Despite PBMC unintentionally transcending the usual shackles of a Happy Maddison movie, it is crucial that the moments that the genius shines through be conveyed to the audience, which is why PB being the ultimate purveyer of PBMC's cynicism is necessary; point a) and b) cannot exist without each other, and thus, Paul Blart Mall Cop exists in a delicate equilibrium.

And that is why Paul Blart Mall Cop is not ""so bad it's good.""

Paul Blart Mall Cop is an unintentional marvel of the whole postmodernist socio-artistic movement.",Super_SATA

Narratives generally override realism for people if they're well put together. That's why people enjoy movies in spite of physics mistakes. If you get bogged down by analyzing technical minutia you're a nerd. That might be a good thing sometimes (I dont use ""nerd"" as a pejorative) but other times you'll annoy the fuck out of everyone.   Most people are paying attention to the big picture story and character narratives and not the physical narrative. 

Reddit is split up into subreddits which allow different degrees of nerdiness in various topics. The bigger the subreddit/audience the larger the chance you'll annoy everyone with technicalities.

Again, in my opinion, Empire is the sequel against which all others are measured.  But the argument could be made, that it really is a perfect sequel, as well as a great movie in isolation.

There is no possible way to make that argument for DMC.  And, as I said, perhaps that's due to the influence of Empire.  But, in my eyes, all sequels are held to that standard.

Is it a good movie on its own?  Is it a good movie within the trilogy?  Does it prop the trilogy up, and prepare me for an ""anything goes"" finale?

DMC answers only the first question with a Yes.  The others are a loud, resounding, NO.

The ship raised with a permanently black hull and thus The Black Pearl was born. In exchange for the ship, Jack had to spend time on Jones' ship after being captain of the pearl for 13 years. I haven't found how many slaves he ended up freeing, but I don't know why Jones would arrive at 99 (was actually 100 but Will Turner).

Reddit hyped it up, trailers looked great, apparently the book was solid, and then came the film...

My fucking God it was terrible. Again, I could rant for days, but it boils down to the whole thing feeling like 4 hours of unconnected, irrelevant shit.

Seriously, it was such a circlejerk of why people should enjoy it, but nothing changed the fact it was bloody awful. I even remember one post showing how the timelines were connected, and it was so absurd and convoluted I fully burst out laughing. Lines were just all over the show. As if they'd just reused props that had little to no relevance to the plot lines.

It just felt less like a big ""everything is connected"" story and more a bunch really terrible, unconnected films. Like they got this solid cast and thought ""Shit, lets use them to make 5 films! What value!""

So he knew *exactly* what to film in order to give his artists the best material to work with, and knew what he wanted out of the effects.

The ""making of"" films for the second and third films are some of the absolute best I've ever seen. There's so much put into those movies, and so many practical effects mixed with absolutely incredible CGI that it's no surprise it holds up to this day.

One example I love is the kraken attack on the Edinburgh Trader. They needed a huge tentacle to come crashing down and split the ship in half, debris and splinters flying everywhere. Simple enough just to do it in CG, right? But no - *they built a full-scale model ship, towed it out to sea, filled a massive pipe with concrete and dropped it on top!* The only CG in that scene is the actors running around on deck, and even that was composited from footage rather than 100% CG models.

It was such a great introduction to the characters we'd come to know and love, and to a world we would never want to leave, even as the last credits were rolling. The first three are such good films, (i don't care for the last two. They have their moments, but are nowhere on the same level as the first three.) 

The Curse gave us the first appearance of Jack Sparrow, before he was overused constantly in the next films, and that scene of him arriving on his sinking ship is iconic. Love the scene where Barbossa and his men are walking under the ships at the bottom of the sea, towards the end of the film. 

Davy Jones is my favourite villain, but Barbossa is great in this one. Also the MUSIC! SO GOOD! Whenever you feel down or miserable, listen to 'He's a Pirate', and just try to not feel empowered, I dare you! 

The banter between Jack and Will is great, as is their first duel, actually all the fight scenes are awesome.

There is a LOT of Plot (with a capital P) and exposition in this film, but it's all presented with this quick witted writing where a pirate speaks with 'undue eloquence' and other characters try and respond appropriately.  You essentially cut half the exposition into fun wordsmithing, naturally force the viewer to pay attention to dialogue (because it's also entertaining), and are able to make a fairly convoluted explanation heavy story not feel like it.

The first one is really really good, apart from the somewhat janky special effects as you mentioned. But the pacing is great, the humor is great, the music is great, Cpt Jack Sparrow is great.

The second film was always my favorite. I love Bill Nighy's Davy Jones. And good lord those Special Effects look like the movie just came out, even after... 15 years? The ""Johnny Depp does goofy shit"" stuff has been amped up which I personally don't like, but everything else in this movie is a solid +1 compared to the first one.

Now the third one is where it starts to fall apart. It's still really good, Beckett and Davy Jones are great villains, I love me some Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa again, more pirate lore is always good and from a technical standpoint the movie is just as good as the previous two. However it  just drags on for sooo long. It feels like two movies put together. Halfway through I found myself thinking ""well there's only this battle missing and then that's it right? Oh right this plot point. And this one. And this one."" and it just kept going and going just like my explanation does! But the ending battle does feel rewarding and the way the trilogy ends feels natural.

I enjoyed the original trilogy overall to some extent (though I would say overall all the movies following the first are mediocre) but perhaps the biggest thing wrong with the sequels are the use of Jack Sparrow. He goes from being this sincerely gray character whose actions you can't predict to this zany flanderized comic relief who you know is always on the right side.

I recently watched a lengthy YouTube video on how good the film is, a lot of the reason it holds up, (besides the perfect cast, perfect score, perfect sets and costume etc.) Is that it's just really efficient story telling, more showing less telling. No huge exposition dump or text crawl in the beginning to explain the world or how it works.

I will often times forget they even made sequels, because I find them to be inferior in almost every way. The fact that Johnny Depp never really captures the performance of Jack Sparrow ever again probably has a lot to do with that.",prismatic_vista

The 5th actually had semi interesting characters (new Will and Elizabeth >>>> the boring af Priest dude and mermaid), Salazar was a cool villain, Jack wasn't perfect by any means but worked better in this than he did 4 because he wasn't the main main character and Barbossa had a good arc.

Consider, for example, Infinity War. Thanos is notoriously on screen for more time than any individual character. However, every single one of those appearances is framed from the perspective of another character, except for when he gets the Soul Stone. Thanos racks up more minutes on screen simply because there are about four and a half perspectives (Thor, Tony, Guardians ensemble/Gamora, Earth heroes) that Thanos interacts with whereas those perspectives largely don't interact with each other.

Now, Black Pearl is a little different because, in principle, Will and Jack spend pretty much the entire movie as a tandem so the question is ""how does he get more screen time?"" And the answer is... because he isn't the main character. We see Jack mostly from Will's perspective. The only real exception is the prison scene which, crucially, resolves itself in Will's arrival. I can't see how else Jack ends up with more screentime than Will. There really can't be much in it at all... at least for Black Pearl.

Having lots of screentime doesn't change Jack's function in the film... screentime merely reflects a combination of what's required for the character + the level of interaction with the perspective characters.",FrameworkisDigimon

This is manipulative writing, have a character make a hard choice kill a loved character you get the feels from the audience and then the first thing in the next film bring back Jack, see Jacks OK and Elizabeth isn't a bitch everything is back to normal.

Almost all of these storylines aren't perspectives but rather side motives that side characters have. The film is very much about Will and Elizabeth and the complications that Jack's completely selfish desires impose on that relationship.

Mainly because Infinity War was still a love letter to fans, with some incredible character interactions and fights that fans had only dreamed of in the years leading up to it. The difference was that Infinity War had impeccable pacing and character usage/development, which was crazy for a movie with that amount of main characters. On top of that they essentially introduced and completely developed Thanos.

Endgame? Absolutely perfect opening. But pacing was ruined after that, with most of the movie until the ending battle being mostly talking. Captain America and Iron Man had fantastic character arcs and endings, but they were really the only ones to have any. Hawkeyes was basically handwaved, Hulks happened off screen, Nat died and no one really cared, and Thors happened really quickly and didn't really get an ending (which I hated after his incredible Ragnarok and Infinity War arc). The final battle was a spectacle but lacked the creativity of Infinity War's battles. And Thanos was turned into yet another bland villain leading an army.

Endgame didn't need the constant bombastic set pieces of Infinity War, but to make up for that they really needed to apply the development Iron Man and Cap got to the rest of the core Avengers team.

Does Jack interfere in Will and Elizabeth relationship?..........no. Will and Elizabeth went looking for Jack of their own free will. You can't say Jack is ""imposing on that relationship"" when they literally went and imposed on his life.

>You know, only tricking him aboard the Flying Dutchman but whatever.

That's not how that happened. You already wrote...""Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass"" Will needed to be on the Dutchman to get the key. Will being 'tricked' to be on the Dutchman was part of their plan. Did you honestly not get that?

Also, once on the Dutchman Will story completely changes and Jack is no longer important. Jack has nothing to do with Will freeing his dad.

>In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. [...] Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him

Again Jack didn't force Elizabeth on board, she comes looking for him. That's Elizabeth imposing into Jacks life. 

Honestly how do you blame Jack because Cutler arrested Elizabeth and forced Will to get Jack compass? How do you blame Jack when Elizabeth hunts Jack down? They imposed on him, not the other way around.

Might I add, if Will had learned his lesson from Curse of the Black Pearl he should have trusted Jack and everything would have worked out. Jack either forces Jones to do what he wants or Jack kills him and takes power. Either way, Jack frees Bootstrap and then give his compass to Will, Will trades compass for Elizabeth. Everyone wins. But no, Will is poorly written and because of his interference Norrington gets the heart and everything gets worse.

>Because she felt guilty for her part in his death and was trying to make up for it.

Instantly? If it was so wrong why kill him in the first place.

I mostly bring this up because it's manipulative and bad writing. Good writing: have a character make a difficult choice to kill someone(specifically a loved character) and then have to deal with guilt and the aftermath of her choice. And the audience has to deal with the lose of Jack and Elizabeth's betrayal. Solid story telling. BAD writing immediately in the next movie undoing all that. Literally what you quoted ""Jacks back. Everything is going to be okay now.""..................that is bad bad bad writing.

>Jack votes for her because she is the only one who will sail the fleet out and attack the EITC.

He has to trust her to do that.

>Your nitpicking hard, and entirely about the wrong things.

It's a major plot point. Jack giving her all the power after see killed him is is dumb and bad writing. Elizabeth never really pays a price for her betrayal and thus can't ever have redemption. She did something pretty evil and they sweep it under the rug, this again is bad writing.

Might I point out more clear bad writing for character development. When is Will and Elizabeth ever going to start trusting Jack? They should have learned that lesson after the first film, by they keep f-ing everything up because they don't trust him. The 2nd/3rd films are full of backstabbing and double crossing. But if they just trusted him things would work out. But again bad writing because we will skip character growth because we need to create turmoil.

>Thats extremely subjective.

It's a common hated trope in writing, it's called the resurrection trope, look it up.

>You must hate most books if characters try to undo their past mistakes is poor writing to you.

That would be nice if that is what happens. What great sacrifice does she do to redeem herself? If she was only doing it as part of Barbosa's plan as you hinted it's self serving. Elizabeth never went above and beyond to redeem herself. Bad writing. And it's even worse because it could have been put in.

>People comment on Jack acting strange the entire movie.

There is a big difference between being scared and acting strange then being easily manipulated and pacified by simple mind tricks.",Bomber131313

The best sequels take a small part of the cast and tell a new story. T2 didn't bring Reese it didn't have endless references to the last film.  The Dark Knight didn't bring back Ra's or reference the league of shadows. Star Wars didn't revisit any location from the previous film.

Try again:

>Jack tricks Will, who is shanghaied into service aboard the Dutchman.

When I write that Will is tricked aboard, what I mean is that Will ends up on a ship thinking one thing but he's actually there for a different, Jack-related, purpose.

>Also, once on the Dutchman Will story completely changes and Jack is no longer important. Jack has nothing to do with Will freeing his dad.

Except, you know, the whole ""I'll get you a bunch of souls, including Will and we'll be square"" thing but we've established that you don't care about what happens in this film so yeah.

>Again Jack didn't force Elizabeth on board,

This is called moving the goalposts. The burden of the argument is merely that Jack and Elizabeth's stories are connected.

>Honestly how do you blame Jack because Cutler arrested Elizabeth and forced Will to get Jack compass? How do you blame Jack when Elizabeth hunts Jack down? They imposed on him, not the other way around.

Just the little matter of selling her fiance's (husband?) soul to Davy Jones, but sure.

>But no, Will is poorly written and because of his interference Norrington gets the heart and everything gets worse.

I mean, sure, if you ignore that Will was already betraying Jack before Jack betrayed Will this makes sense.

It's not a Jack-related purpose it's a Cutler-related purpose. Will wants the compass for Cutler, getting the compass is Will's purpose(until dad shows up). 

>Except, you know, the whole ""I'll get you a bunch of souls, including Will and we'll be square"" thing but we've established that you don't care about what happens in this film so yeah.

You really didn't get this film did you. You already said Will made a deal with Jack key for compass. And the key is on the Dutchman, it is part of Jack and Will's plan to 'trick' Will onto the Dutchman. Will is in on the trick. Its a con job to get Will on the boat to get the key. How did you not get that? Honestly how else would Will get on the boat?

>The burden of the argument is merely that Jack and Elizabeth's stories are connected.

No the burden of the argument is on who 'imposed' on whom. Jake did go to Will and Elizabeth. Will and Elizabeth put themselves there. You can't blame Jake when Will and Elizabeth came to him. They imposed on Jack.

>Just the little matter of selling her fiance's (husband?) soul to Davy Jones, but sure.

And again, that is part of WILL and Jack plan. 

>I mean, sure, if you ignore that Will was already betraying Jack before Jack betrayed Will this makes sense.

Disney and WB are just following the standard release template that has been around for decades, there's no reason for them to waste money going all out on a physical release. I would not be surprised to hear Disney opts out of physical releases altogether in the next ten or fifteen years as they take control of Hulu. Once they do, the other studios will follow. I'm sure companies like Criterion will start having to manufacture their own Blu-Ray players at that point, as well, since the tech companies like Sony and Samsung are not going to see a reason in making those devices when only a niche part of the populace uses them.

Most films released between the mid 2000s until very recently, regardless of whether they were shot on film or digital, went through a 2K digital post-production process. On the 4K releases, unless it's film and they do a re-scan, you're gonna get an upscale. But that upscale can do a few things. 1080p is slightly less resolution than 2K, so there's that already, but also 4K discs allow for much stronger compression and better resolution for fine details, so it's completely possible for a 4K release to have better detail than a blu-ray. Then there's the HDR factor, which alone can improve an image in big ways if deployed right. Hell, for all the problems with the new LotR 4K releases, the HDR basically makes them worthwhile all on their own. Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2K upscale, and it looks absolutely terrific (though some have noted that the flames can occasionally look slightly wonky in HDR).

As for being a lot of work. Honestly, it's not that much work if you're doing a straight upscale. The work comes in the HDR grade, which isn't nothing, but if you're trying to sell some 4K discs and iTunes purchases, it can be worth it for a studio to undertake.",cupofteaonme

Not that the UHD's don't for the most part look better than the Blu-rays, though there are occasional moments where the UHD has been so scrubbed that it ends up worse. Overall, though, the 4K releases are an improvement, especially thanks to the HDR, and fixing the teal issue on Fellowship of course. But there has been zero evidence that new scans were undertaken, and usually when they are, the differences are far more pronounced.

Often it's just a matter of what's affordable. 2K is cheaper to scan, and quite a bit cheaper to work with in terms of restoration. But it's also often a matter of how well the source film stands up to scanning. A lot of those martial arts movies were done in a 35mm format that used half the frame, and thus don't actually have as much detail to resolve, so 2K is really all you need. Would 4K be better? Technically, sure, but you're not necessarily gonna get an improvement significant enough to justify it. And you're almost definitely not going to get an improvement big enough to justify a whole new scan and restoration. Could they upscale that 2K and try to add an HDR grade? Sure. But again... the expense.

There are also examples like Kino's UHD release of The Good the Bad and the Ugly, which is in 4K, but without HDR. And apparently that's because the film elements they were dealing with, while detailed enough to warrant a 4K scan and restoration, didn't have enough latitude in the dynamic range to work well with HDR.

A similar thing happened recently with the Blu-ray release of the British movie Censor, which was shot with a variety of formats, mostly film, but with some digital as well. It was originally announced as getting a 4K release with HDR, but as it turned out, the DI had been done in 2K, which already makes it just an upscale, and apparently the DI had been done in such a way that it couldn't accommodate HDR very well, so they cancelled the 4K release and are just putting it out on regular Blu-ray.",cupofteaonme

Either way, they do not appear to be based on new scans.

>Except for the guys who actually, y'know, made the 4K transfer.

Nobody involved in the production of the discs has said that the 4K releases were made from brand new film scans, so I'm not sure what you're referring to.

**Edit:** I see you're a big fan of ninja edits. For the record, every time there is a new scan done, the texture of the image will look slightly different, and this will be clear even through the DNR. This is because scanners are different from each other, never mind a change in resolution of the scan. While the 4K image has clearly been remastered on the newer releases, with new colour grading and DNR and all that jazz, it does not appear to have been sourced from a new scan.

Furthermore, there is more DNR applied to the effects shots than the non-effects shots, so the notion that it was to make everything match is silly. In fact, an easier way to make everything match would have been to add *more* grain to the effects shots so that they look more appropriately filmic, rather than scrubbing the grain so it looks waxy and smeary in motion, with artificial sharpening that actually makes the effects composites look worse in some cases.

Truth is, with this release there are two separate things going on. The first is that they did an upscale and remastering of pre-existing scans. This on its own wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. The second thing is that Jackson has become enamoured of digital smoothing in general, seen in his recent documentaries, and in this release. That second thing is where the real trouble arises. While it's unfortunate we couldn't get full new scans of the negatives and film-outs, there's a universe in which the upscaling method was used with an intention to maintain the trilogy's filmic look. Instead, Jackson went the other direction, making a trio of 35mm-shot films look more digital. Not totally digital. They still do look basically like film. But seriously futzed with.

Thanks for explaining what, exactly, generates the noise. The fact that it's called ""noise"" when there is no picture and ""grain"" by useless geeks like yourself when there is a picture does not change the simple fact that the grain is, literally, noise. Shoot a still scene with film, what does the grain do? Do those crystals align up in precisely the same way frame to frame, so it is indistinguishable from a still photo? No, it moves completely randomly, changing entirely from one frame to the next. This is literally the textbook definition of noise.

Grain also isn't ""essential"" to the film experience. It is simply a natural component of anything shot on film, because the image is literally made up of grain, similar to digital images being made up of pixels. Some filmmakers will choose to shoot on film in a way that accentuates the grain, while others will seek a less grainy image by shooting with more light or a larger gauge film stock. It can be an artistic choice. A lot of movies shot digitally will have a layer of grain added in the DI, because overly sharp (not detailed, but sharp) images don't always look super pleasing, or might not match the filmmaker's intended look.

Often times it might not even be the people that customer's would pick.  If you were picked and advertised as the top sales person then maybe customers might want to work with you.

But as to whether it's a classic, that's hard to say. Raiders, BTTF and Jurassic Park are all more iconic--not just in their merchandise and franchising, but also in movie making in general. From my point of view, BTTF and Jurassic Park in particular set new standards for what Time Travel and Monster movies offered.

But not all roles are equal. Don't get me wrong a LOVE Captain Jake, and you are right he is the only one who could play him. Just for Oscar the depth of character or acting level to bring that character to the screen is the important part, not if you can do that character best. Ryan Reynolds is PERFECT as Deadpool and no one could be better, you think that is Oscar worthy? I hope no, because the character of Deadpool is not better then other deeper characters.

Barbosa because despite his actions, he still manages to be such a fun villain. The film convinces you to feel at least a little sorry for his and his lot, but he still revels in being the bad guy and it's such a joy to watch. Geoffrey Rush kills it in this role. Genuinely in my top 3 favorite movie characters ever.

Norrington I like because he's set up to be this insufferable hardass who always gets outsmarted by everyone else, but every time he's on screen he becomes more and more likable. He's brave, smart, honorable, a good fighter, and a great leader. When Elizabeth chooses Will over him, the only thing he's concerned about is making sure Will treats her right and he suspects that will be the case so he wishes them well. You kinda feel sorry for him because he clearly would have been a great husband for Elizabeth. He deserves to be happy just as much if not more than any of the other protagonists.",

In the script Captain Jack was a pirate but also the classic hero type. In fact Disney was so upset that he was ""derailing their franchise"" they had very high level meetings about firing him and getting someone else.  The reason the other films aren't as good is really simple, instead of writing another movie and having Johnny do his thing again, they wrote the movie about Johnny doing his thing.

I say this fully knowing the downvotes are imminent,  I‚Äôll back that up by saying i thought the kraken was terrifying and there has been nothing quite like it in cinema at this scale and looking this good in the history of film.  I thought the mythology of Davy Jones and his cursed crew was more interesting than Barbossa‚Äôs and the character design and ship design were beautifully varied and original (even though Geoffrey Rush clearly has the better performance as Barbossa.). The different heroes and anti heroes clashing in the middle of the film (Will, Sparrow, Davy Jones, and Norrington?) was an interesting display with each character representing something quite different and with alliances being made and broken in the same scene if i remember correctly.  Could almost be compared to the character interaction and representation  in the Dark Knight (Batman, Dent, Joker, Gordon).  I thought the action was much better choreographed in the second film to where It was clear each swing of the sword where the blocking of characters were and who was winning/losing to a degree better than Black Pearl.  I liked the cinematography better in the second where there was a Stark contrast.  Dead Mans was much brighter and sunnier and i thought the Carribean is more suited to that Pallet and Lighting and it really gave the a chance for the character of ‚ÄúThe Sea‚Äù to come alive more in this film as opposed to the darker lit and more night time scenes of Pearl.  Anyway, this is just my opinion with examples to back it up.  Anytime I give an opinion that‚Äôs goes agains the popular opinion I get roasted with ‚Äú Your wrong because your wrong.‚Äù   I would love to hear not just that I am wrong, but also why I am wrong.

movies,8syksn,The Curse Of The Black Pearl,e14gx7c,2018-06-22 18:49:24,"It's because the LOTR movies were revolutionarily dorky for their time. It's challenging to keep that in perspective now when we have TV shows like Game Of Thrones. People in 1999 thought these Rings movies would never work, and even if they did, would never attract a mainstream audience.

Due to that, a lot of the creative decisions PJ made in adapting LOTR were aimed at making the story have more mainstream appeal. After the fellowship splits, the story turns into two parallel threads. And one of these side by side stories is *a lot* more mainstream than the other. One story is about a prince and his cool comic-relief sidekicks returning to the prince's kingdom, fighting awesome battles against a demon king and winning a princess's hand. And the other is about two homoerotic leprechauns being led through a swamp by a CGI skeleton-man on a quest to throw away magic jewelry with heavy Christian overtones.

One of these stories is seminal (but generic) high fantasy that went on to influence the way we think about fantasy archetypes (D&D etc), and the other story is Tolkien being Tolkien in a way that no other fantasy writer has copied.

That is why Peter Jackson, throughout the trilogy, made adaptation decisions that leaned hard in the direction of making the movie about Aragorn. It's hard to blame him as, again, *nobody knew* if the Gollum CGI would even work. Gollum is barely in Fellowship and only in scenes in the dark where the CGI is forgiving. 

To be fair to PJ, he did undo some of his early script decisions once he saw how well the Frodo/Sam/Gollum stuff was working. For instance, the final battle in ROTK was supposed to be Aragorn ***fighting Sauron***. They changed it to a troll at the last minute.

What makes Fellowship stand the test of time more than the other movies is that it's a more faithful adaptation. PJ can't lean too hard into Aragorn.

The Hobbit movies have the opposite problem. There are so many characters that PJ is more interested in than Bilbo, chief among them Thorin. So Thorin becomes ""The Aragorn of The Hobbit.""",Deggit

movies,8syksn,The Curse Of The Black Pearl,e14fj7b,2018-06-22 18:29:07,"I think the 2nd and 1st movies are definitely the only films that understand the core appeal.... Pirates Of The Caribbean isn't about Jack Sparrow and it's not even about pirates, really. It's about THE SEA. 

When Will answers the call to adventure in the first movie, it's in the form of sneaking aboard a ship and putting out to sea. You know how the heroes in an adventure movie always get a big setback at about the 1 hour mark before they fight back to win? In Pirates, it's when Jack and Elizabeth get captured and then marooned... on land. Pretty much everything else in the movie between Will going to sea to rescue Elizabeth, and Elizabeth's wedding at the end, is sea stuff. COOL sea stuff, like the classic ""THEY'RE CLUB HAULIN'!"" scene. The ships are real, the maneuvers are real, the nautical lingo is real, and everything is done to make you feel like you're there despite the massive expense of shooting a movie in the middle of the ocean.

Where the series increasingly went wrong, from ""At World's End"" onwards, is it turned the sea into like this mythical place where anything could happen with CGI. The scene at the end of Pirates 3 where Commander Beckett gets his ship blown up into CGI confetti while he descends the staircase without a scratch is a good example of how the movies (deliberately and consciously) abandoned the idea of making the sea scenes as realistic and immersive as they could. There's nothing wrong with CGI spectacle movies, but there's a lot of them. When Pirates was actually about what it's like to be aboard a real non-CGI'd ship, it was unique.",Deggit

The first is just such a perfect blend of dramatic action and tongue-in-cheek nonsense, and all the characters feel unique and play an interesting part in the movie. 

Dead Man's Chest loses a little of the charm as it feels a little too 'sequel-ly'; the action is probably the best of the series but as a result they sacrifice some of the individuality of the characters to make them all swashbuckling badasses (see Elizabeth) but all the Davy Jones stuff is just phenomenal. 

At World's End is probably my least favourite of the three but I don't think it deserves half the hate it gets. I'll say it's slow to get going, it's cheesy as hell at parts, and it introduces way too much lore in a single movie but beyond that everything's pretty awesome. I find the plot itself to be the most interesting and layered of all the films, and the often lamented backstabbing just adds to the fun and twists the narrative in some pretty neat directions. And that final battle is undeniably a sight to behold.

Nothing they introduced broke any of the story from the previous movies--it instead built up the narrative to the peak it could go two. 

Same goes for the characters, who were still at core the people we met in Curse, but with enough evolution for their decisions to still make sense.Sparrow as a character still had integrity, and this was before he was written into self-parody in the godawful last one.

Think back to the reveal in *Black Pearl* about the undead curse. It was this huge ""ta-da!"" that completely caused the movie to pivot. What started out as a clever swashbuckling movie with pirates, damsels, and a Royal Navy, suddenly changes into a story about mythical curses, and the undead!

*Dead Man's Chest* opens with things ""back to normal."" With familiar characters of Will & Elizabeth and Port Royal. The plot begins with Will & Elizabeth being blackmailed to find Jack Sparrow. We see pirate bars, and pirates and Royal Navies! And again, the movie pivots with Davy Jones! But he isn't just some pirate! He is a sea monster! And he has THE KRACKEN! The whole mythology just busts open! The Flying Dutchman is now some sort of magical place with even more interesting characters too!

*At World's End* opens up still amid what was happening in *Dead Man's Chest*. If anything, it feels like the same movie, but that isn't a bad thing. We are back in the driver's seat with Will, Elizabeth, Jack, and everybody else. By the end we have gone full circle. We have met tons of cool characters., been introduced to tons of mythos and codes. The story has met it's natural conclusion; boy wins girl, heroic trio saves the day, the main characters have gone through real development and growth, the monster is defeated, and the wily Jack skirts off to have so many unbelievable adventures! (Sea Turtles, mate.)

But the fourth movie, *On Stranger Tides*, we open to just Jack on his own. We dive right into unfamiliar places, with unfamiliar faces. We are given almost no time to care about any plot. The writers banked on people loving Johnny Depp as Jack, and Barbosa & his monkey to be enough ""nostalgia"" for us. And, it just doesn't work. 

Now, what is worse is that Disney knows *Stranger Tides* wasn't well received. But rather than examine why and fix it, they attempt to rehash the same concepts that worked before (Heroic Trio, Evil Monster Captain with a Magic Boat, Some Artifacts, and a Curse), and just hoped we would come back. 

At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

Jack randomly starts asking people to *pay him* for saving him. This is completely new for him. And it's all explained as his back story. That's great for a standalone character, I guess. But for a character *in movie fucking FIVE*?!

Not to mention that it goes against the grain of what Jack was in the first movie. Many people don't know about Jack's past, as set out in the first movie, and almost completely revealed by a deleted scene from the first movie.

Jack Sparrow was a privateer. He decided to sail under the command of The East Empire Trading Company, for none other than Cutler Becket, one of the main antagonists of the first movie.

Jack Sparrow, a law-abiding sailor, was transporting slaves on behalf of Cutler Becket and TEETC but had a change of heart and liberated them.

He liberated a hundred slaves. Remember that number.

For liberating the slaves, he was branded a pirate (quite literally, as seen on his wrist, by Cutler Becket), and his ship The Wicked Wench, was burned and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.

Jack, now branded a pirate, Did Some Stuff‚Ñ¢, and then went to meet with Davy Jones. Davy Jones agreed to resurrect the Wicked Wench from the depths for the price of Jack's soul eternally at the helm of the Flying Dutchman when he was done.

And then Barbosa mutinied and Jack lost the pearl.

This is referenced in a sly way later on, in Dead Man's Chest, when Davy Jones requests 'a hundred souls' in exchange for Jack's freedom from his debt.

And all of this is referenced in a deleted scene with Jack Sparrow and Cutler Beckett talking and Jack says 'People aren't cargo, mate'.

And then.

Movie five.

Nah he was just always a pirate. Got his command by smashing up Salazar. All that crap with the Wicked Wench/Pearl, all of that. Just nah. Throw that all away!

POTC are incredible as a trilogy. But four and five just ruined it by trying to be too quirky and change established backstories.

I love the first three to death. But after that, it went too far. It strayed too much. It tried to add shit to characters that didn't need adding to. It's like a soap opera that went on too long and is *screaming* for ways to attract new viewers and just kept adding more and more crazy shit in an attempt to retain viewership, not realising they'd jumped the shark long ago.",Why-so-delirious

It really is in a league of its own thanks to fantastic storytelling and how well it handled its horror/adventure elements. Dead Man's Chest is quite good, extremely fun and enjoyable (love that cannibal island opening, the Kraken, the three-way sword fight, etc.) and expanded the universe in awesome ways (Davy Jones is imo the best-looking CGI character ever thanks both to creature design and amazing effects), but by the third, the script had grown into a convoluted mess. Having said that, At World's End is still an enjoyable flick, I like all the POTC movies (even 4 and 5 to a lesser degree...though Jack's deterioration as a character is more evident than ever in that last one) but LOVE 1 and hold 2 above 3 4 and 5. 

What makes me really enjoy the first three movies so much is Gore Verbinski's direction. He's a master at spacial awareness during action scenes and sets up really creative set-pieces that would make Buster Keaton proud. This is the legacy of the POTC franchise for me.  ",

I‚Äôve been a PotC fan since it was announced. I love these movies, and I agree that the first one is a perfect film. 

They lost the original spark chasing the money with the last two (of the trilogy), it felt like to me. The original was so great because it toed the line between reality and fantasy. It wasn‚Äôt bang you over the head with fantasy plot and elements- it was a smattering of fantasy in a swashbuckling character movie. It was a love story and a comedy. It was a historical film and a fantasy movie. It dealt with the dark and with the light. You could believe that the entire plot happened in real life, and no one would have been the wiser. It brought back pirates in a pirate dead market. 

Jack Sparrow was a phenomenal character, as evidenced by his explosion in popularity. Because he was so grey. He was dirty and ruthless, you never fully understood if he was madness or genius, yet in the end he always landed on the side of the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù. He won even if he played dirty. You could root for him even if he did a few bad things. Throughout the rest of the movies after the original one, he slowly turned into a overblown stereotype of himself. They thought CotBP was so successful because of Jack, but it was really the entire movie all together that made it so wonderful. 

4 and 5 it clearly became ‚Äúthe jack sparrow show‚Äù. The original trilogy is great, like you said, and I enjoy watching them every once in a while. But the first one is just fantastic and if they had stopped there I would have been completely satisfied. After the first movie, there are plot holes that don‚Äôt make sense, scenes that are obvious fan service, jokes that fall flat, and plot lines that make you either roll your eyes or wonder if you‚Äôre dreaming.

I never expected the first one to be any good until I saw it on DVD about a year later and realized how good it was, and I saw all of the subsequent films in theaters.

That includes 4 and 5, incidentally, even if those weren't as good. I think it might have been best to keep it at 3... and yet I still found myself buying tickets. 4 was more interesting than I think it gets credit for. It works mostly as a standalone, like the original, and it had some interesting character choices, but it suffered from being adapted from a pre-existing source, and most of the new characters lacked the personality of the ones we'd met in previous films. I felt Blackbeard was good, though, owing largely to Ian McShane's performance.

5, well... I sort of just wanted a night out, really. It was probably slightly more entertaining than 4 overall, but more of the same. If you've seen any previous POTC film, you know almost exactly what to expect from this one. Still, it at least resolved some character arcs.

I keep watching these movies mostly out of habit, and to support pirate films in general. Once a booming genre, it was dead for decades until POTC came along. I'm not sure if there's a way to do it better than what this franchise did, but I'd at least like others to try.",PercyHavok

The next two are OK. I've not seen the last two because they looked like they were trying to get blood from a stone. 

I can't stand the character of Elizabeth Swann. I hate how she put her pirate fantasy/obsession ahead of just about everything else. I hate how she gets turned up to eleven without any real explanation of how she gets from lady who can't breathe in a corset to total badass. Every decision she makes is the ""correct"" one and she never has to make any sacrifices. She gets everything she wants in the end. Will Turner starts off ok but is eventually sucked in to this writing as well.

Everyone goes on about Jack Sparrow and I liked him in the first three, so that's all I'll say about him.  

The character I really liked (and who I think gets overlooked) was Norrington. He's Will's love-rival to Elizabeth and could have been set up as unlikeable as is usually done. Instead he is portrayed as a good, honorable man who is hyper competent and who unselfishly puts everyone else's interests ahead of his own (a trait which ultimately gets him dishonored and killed). He's a foil not only to Jack Sparrow but to Elizabeth Swann in this way.

He actually has a nice character arc where he actually experiences plausible growth and changes. He is an incredibly conflicted character by the second movie and into the third, having fallen from Grace, and while he's never truly able to recapture who he was before, he's also no longer lost in life. He's able to reclaim ownership of his principles and behave honorably, even if his concept of ""honor"" has evolved.

And then they killed him off in probably the stupidest way possible. Yes, it's 2018 and I'm still upset about it. Here's the best swordsman in the cast and he gets one-shotted by a shambling, demented zombie. Here's the only truly ""good guy"" and he doesn't get a happy ending. There was so much more that could have been done with Norrington, especially with how he and Sparrow just *gel*... But he got the stabby death and literally everyone forgot about him and his sacrifice. It was a huge disappointment for me.

The movie does not reveal everything in detail at the very beginning. Rather, it slowly unravels it.

Dead man's chest on the other hand, had the best scene of the entire franchise in my opinion. I am talking about Davy Jones's introduction. ""Do you fear death?"" scene is so awesome.

If you ever watch it again, pay attention to the nonverbal exchanges during the parlay, and watch as Will, Jack, and Elizabeth all gradually end up on the same page of the plan, while Barbossa ends up left out. From that perspective, Elizabeth‚Äôs speech ends up almost entirely intended for Barbossa‚Äôs benefit, to motivate him back into the fight by using some of his own words for inspiration.

Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, etc. Last week we watched the first three Pirates movies. I hadn't seen them in years; the first one being the only one I'd seen more than twice.

I always liked the trilogy, more so than most people, who seem to be rather critical of part 2 and 3. Having seen them again, I can definitely see where the criticism is coming from. The first one was a near flawless adventure movie, very much in the vein of a Indiana Jones film. Part 2 and 3 in comparison are rather filled with too much exposition, characters with motives and goals and generally just too much 'stuff'. Constantly thinking about what event means what for which character gets in the way of enjoying the film and ends up being a bit tiring, which I could see on my sisters reaction, but also on my own. We still ended up enjoying part 2 and 3.

But there is one thing I really admire about the Pirates movies. Considering that the first movie was born out of a theme park ride, an idea so corporate and eye-roll-inducing, those movies really had no fucking right to feature such incredibly creative, fun and awesome world-building and sense of time and place.

In no way am I disrespecting the character infact I think he is one of the best movie characters I've come across but that's the thing with these characters there's this sort of feeling of myth with these characters which makes them mysterious and awe inspiring and by fanserving in giving them more time sort of ruins that feeling of mysteriousness take joker from tdk, little finger and varys from asoiaf",shanumanu97

* The Lord of the Rings 
* Harry Potter 
* Star Wars Prequels
* The Matrix Trilogy
* Spider-Man 1 & 2
* Shrek movies
* Finding Nemo

I could go on and on about movies that more notable between 2003-2007, maybe even giving a few extra years as buffer. It's easy to see why they sort of fall behind so many films that came out back then. They're good, but not *great*.

I would also say Back to the Future is a perfect film. A tight script, many setups and payoffs (in BttF EVERY setup has a payoff) with good dialogue, it's well filmed, well paced, great characters... a perfect film. I wouldn't change a thing. 

What a great analysis man. Dead man's chest did capture the imagination. World's End did just up the extremity of most everything. I would say it's the beginning of the end of REAL Jack Sparrow, though, because he started becoming a caricature of himself. Black Pearl Jack was a swashbuckling pirate on the loose, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants side. But he wasn't an idiot or loon. In Dead Man's chest he was similar but consumed with fear and self interest, still Jack but the situation pushed his personality. World's End Jack is still Jack but all the stuff going on is ridiculous. But at this point, Johnny Depp decided that this was normal Jack. So for the next two films, Jack is a bit too much.

5 I saw in theaters and it made me sad. Like Pirates of the Caribbean to me is that moment when you're in the boat going past the guy playing banjo, there's a mist on the water... you enter this dim tunnel and behold! A skull speaking to you! As a kid that looked real as life and it scared the hell outta me. The first half of the ride is eery and spooky, then it lightens up. But the excitement and mystery is the first part. Curse of the Black Pearl captured that. There was a good bit of that in 4 even, moreso than 3. But Pirates 5? The greatest offense to me, which is indicative of the whole movie, is the background of the end credits. It looks like a happy screensaver! It looked cheap, bright, and thrown together. 

That's my biggest gripe with 5. I mean Javier Bardem seemed to get it with his character, but the mystery and the magic was just absent from the rest of the movie. ",

You are completely taken by the action, I don't know about you but that never happens with modern blockbusters like the avengers. The third one finally offers the ending of all the numerous interests which grew on each character through previous movies (the staring game when they meet on the small island before the big fight while epic morricone's music is playing says it all).

The third one is the best in terms of everything except jack sparrow., and one of my favorite movies. The mythos and complications of jacks background are very well done. Easy to handle and they make sense for the character but jack himself just hasn't done it for me in some time, probably not since the 2nd movie.  The 5th one saw a return to a style most comparable to the 2nd movie which was a good sign.  At world's end proposed a theme that I wish the further movies had kept going with, ""Who is Jack Sparrow?""

Another weird thing is people complaining about there being too much physical comedy and ""quipping"" in modern franchise/action movies, which I just find odd considering some of the most quoted moments of classic action films like Terminator 2 and Die Hard were played for laughs.

It's dir. Gore Verbinsky at his best and the whole is done at the height of HW's fantasy renaissance, as it were. There are quite a *few* adaptations out there that deserve the genre related to 'epic romances' and both LOTR, the HP adaptations, and Pirates did that. As far as fantasy franchises go, it's still a wonderful benchmark that even its own later entries can't top. We were arguing on r/Fantasy about how the quality of 'epic fantasy' films declined because at least in the 2000s the decade had a pop-culture that existed in the shadows of 9/11 and Gulf War 2. The epic war genre can thrive in that sort of imagination, the first three Pirates films are an example -- all about the 'pirate subculture' at war. If this was made in the 1990s it'd just stop short of simply being ABOUT the pirate subculture, minus the grand stakes and military backdrop. In the 2010s, the shift in the popular imaginations has been from 'war' to 'alternate realities' (the internet and digital technology has sort of made 'other realities' more ubiquitious in this decade than it did in the last) and it's unfortunate that the pirates franchise hasn't quite managed to capture that essence as of yet. Though not for lack of trying. Any cinematic 'universe' will attest to that. Jack Sparrow bringing up the need for anonymity and other Robinsonades about the #MeToo movement? A pirate prime minister ? I know people dislike Kiera Knightley but I thought she was a very important part of the cast that made the plot compelling.

I found the pacing, especially in the first half, to be all over the place. When I reached the 1 hour mark, it felt like the actual plot was just getting started despite being almost halfway through the running time, and found myself very disappointed that the ending of the film didn't conclude the story in a satisfactory way. It felt to me that they were trying to make an ""Empire Strikes Back"" type of sequel where the cast is at their lowest point by the end, and the audience is supposed to think ""oh boy, how will our heroes get out of this pickle"" before a glimmer of hope appears. However, to me it felt slightly disingenuous, like more of a ""to be continued"" instead of setting up interesting events to come.

Additionally, I was hoping for more from the sailor mythology aspect of the world, the scenes about Davy Jones' heart and the key, where they were picking apart the legend to find the truth is very interesting to me, but I ended up having more questions then there were answers. Elements like ""Why do they turn into sea creatures"" or ""where did the kracken come from, and why does he have control over it"" were left completely up in the air. I understand that not fully understanding a supernatural thing makes it more fascinating, but to only answer some of those questions and not others felt more like they were padding content for the third installment.

My personal favorite is At World's End, it makes me sad people don't like it very much. I think it's really misunderstood. I find it absolutely brilliant and epic and the entire battle sequence + Beckett's death give me chills, so we'll done. Also, it simply has the best soundtrack. Hans Zimmer created a masterpiece. 
lastly, I don't understand people's issues with Jack. The last two  movies I do, whatever, Im talking about the first three. I think in all of those Jack was still the same, endearing pirate. obviously, with new stories and side plots, you get to see new layers, but the first three were still absolutely great. but I'm biased because I absolutely adore the trilogy, and again the third one is my favorite. I might also add that it was a but ahead of its time with the great, strong female characters (interestingly 3/5 female characters that had a more significant role, were POC) Anyway, nice to see people give some attention to PotC.

Otherwise I think they are fine. Even great at times. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa was iconic and continued to deliver through the initial trilogy and Depp was at the top of his game.

In many ways it's even better than the critic darlings that are the Lords of the Rings. It was harmed in terms of reviews by being based on a theme park ride instead of a respected literary work, but it has a freshness that nothing else from its time really matches. Also, nobody mentions this, but the choreography of the action scenes is fucking great. Compare the cgi heaviness and shoddy editing of the Cave Troll fight in Fellowship with the elegance of Jack's fight with Will in Curse of the Black Pearl.

The second is a mess of a script, but has probably the most iconic imagery in the series. Truth is I don't even care that the entire Pelegostos scene weights the plot down, since the tradeoff is one of the best action setpieces ever.

In the opinion the main problem with the third, more than the increasingly convoluted plot and flanderization of Jack's character, is that the massive sense of scale and high stakes \(that reading other comments here apparently some people loved, but not me\) absolutely does not fit the franchise. The Brethren Court is a terrible idea that  forces the freedom loving characters of Jack and Barbossa into the role of semi\-bureaucrats,  the new ultra complex lore doesn't fit tonally with the careless, easy going essence of being a pirate as we see it the first movie. Trying to give a bigger ""meaning"" to everything \(even Ragetti's wooden eye, damn it\) makes the movie feel too self\-important and robs the franchise of its fundamental pleasure, which was the basic fun of just going on an pirate adventure. Ironically it tried too much to be like LoTR and was harmed by that, becoming sort of a weird tonal hybrid of the two franchises.",UnderwaterSharkFight

Some clearly viewed it in a manner to shit on it, with all the reasons it'll suck in their mind. Checking them off at the first hint of each one.     
A large section of reviews and negative online comments read like they could have been talking about 4. If you wrote down all the reasons the next film will suck based on 4. I think those preconceived issues really clouded peoples judgement.     Y
eah difference of opinions, but I really felt a lot of reviews were all the ways a pirates sequel will suck and often the critiques didn't gel at all with my experience of the film. It was all why the franchise sucks since number 4, not caring whether 5 did the same thing, addressed those issues, did them better or even caring if it was a good and entertaining film.

In the 3rd movie he's reduced (OUT of nowhere) to just a guy horny for the Super-woman-voodoo chick; what could have been a Faust-esque battle of wits between pirates and Satan (the deceivest humans vs the deceivest entity), was shrunk down to a super-villain battle. Meh.

The second and third were good, the problem is that they just couldn't compare to the first film. POTC 1 was one of those movies that just gets it all right, every single thing right in my opinion

Since 2 and 3 weren't as good as 1 they get a bad rap, and probably looked at harsher than they deserve. Some of the criticism is warranted, the films for example do get worse as they go on IMO

But all in all this is very similar to similar series. To make a slightly random comparison with another Disney franchise, Lion King. Lion King 1 is another example of a nigh on perfect film, and I feel both Lion King 2 and Lion King 1¬Ω get undue criticism as a result (plus being Disney direct-to-dvd sequels doesn't help).

First Film: Obviously great; It brought back that feeling I had in watching the original Star Wars films. It was just an adventure film that was done really well. It was a movie that didn't need a lot of surprises, just to invest you along the way so that the plot points felt earned. I think this is something Hollywood is forgetting. Surprises for the sake of surprises aren't satisfying. 

Second Film: I actually loved the second one at first, and I think most people initially did too, but it was one of those movies that got more hate the more it sat. The set pieces and scope of that movie, especially with the Kracken scenes are amazing. The introduction of Davy Jones, made for a wonderful character intro that was built up so much that he easily could have disappointed, but didn't. Still, I remember immediately feeling like all the story points they put out, were becoming too many, and it was going to be difficult to wrap it up by the third film in a way that was both satisfying and well earned. That film's ultimate judgement was always going to be based on how well the third one wrapped up it's (second film's) Story elements, and I think the hollow feeling from third, left the second one in a kind of purgatory, that's difficult to be judged on its own merits

Third Film: While I didn't hate it, it was the most disappointing for me. That said, I think that it was somewhat the fault of the second movie for introducing too many different story elements and moving parts like I previously mentioned. Not only did they have to wrap those up, but they introduced even MORE of those type of things. All that considered, they at least found ways to wrap up everything in ways that made sense. It just got to be too much. Though still a better movie, it suffered from the same problem as spider man 3 in that there were too many story threads that were put out, for any of their resolutions to feel earned, and meaningful. I still cared about what happened to the characters because of the threads from the previous films, but their arcs within that film, felt too rushed, convoluted, and unearned. It's a credit to the film that those arcs were easy enough to keep track of, it's just that too much happened, with too many different elements, for the character plots and motivations within that film to truly have satisfying conclusions. Decent conclusions sure, but ultimately hollow. Also, they became too reliant on ""twists."" Like I said about the first movie, a good adventure movie doesn't need to have surprises just for the sake of them. Predictable plot points that are earned through evoking emotion, is far better than a ""twist"" that doesn't grow out of a Character motivation that I'm very invested in. Investing in those character motivations takes time, time that the third movie was unable to allow for, making all those twists seem actually kind of boring because of the sheer overload of them.

But then I rewatched them a few years ago and they were quite entertaining.

I do think part of the lost luster is just the inherent nature of the where they went with the story.  So much of the excitement and love of pirates and that era of seafaring is about mystery and the romance of open possibilities.  But as the story moves on those possibilities become constrained and romance goes down not up.

I almost feel like a prequel would be more successful in capturing the feel of the original, but it is hard to throw away such cash cow characters/actors.",

That is possible because the film isn't ostensibly about Jack but Johnny Depp takes every opportunity to ham it up and steal scenes, and the editing and directing is good enough that not only does it not ruin anything but the Jack part becomes this bit of clowning chaos that is always exciting/fresh for the audience.

The issue with in the next two films is that they pull focus and make Jack's mythology the focus. That in and of itself is fine because Will and Elizabeth don't really have sufficient back story you could use to fashion more episodes from. But once Jack is the focus Johnny Depp no longer has the room to upstage the other players, he is already the focus, so there's no limelight to steal. Hamming it up more is no longer adding anything, the audience already get it so there's no need to lay it on as thick. Films 2 and 3 would be stronger if Jack's part was played a little more straight, rather than doubling down and creating a caricature of the part.",danby

I can't be asked to care about the end of the world because I know you can't do a sequel if the good guys lose and the world ends.

The trick to a good action-adventure is making the stakes work so that the bad guy can win and you can still make a sequel. That's why The Empire Strikes Back is so damn good -- Vader doesn't want to kill Luke, he wants him to join forces and rule the galaxy together. Boba Fett doesn't want to kill Han, he just wants to take him to Jabba. If the good guys lose that final battle, we can still have another Star Wars film, so the stakes mean something.",

Then in the second and third movie Jack was written like Depps Jack and that is where a bit of the magic got lost. Jack seemed really clever in the first one- clever while hiding that cleverness beneath an act. In two and three he still seemed intelligent at crucial points, but he's fully embracing the ""act"", the... madness.

Only to find that the swords are stuck to their display case and she can‚Äôt get them free, and ends up having to hide. 

That kind of showed her character. She is brave and clever. But not a fighter. She thought her way out of her problems. Convincing the pirates to parlay. Burning the rum as a signal. The whole ghost woman thing in the second one fits, too. But having her become a badass with a sword kind of ruined her character for me. 

Not because a woman can‚Äôt fight pirates, but because it‚Äôs such a lazy solution to solving her problems. She should have managed to become a pirate lord without ever actually knowing how to swing a sword. ",kung-fu_hippy

Lots of movies don't take themselves seriously nowadays. I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

However, I do agree with you in a sense. The comedy in the Black Pearl just works so well in a way that it doesn't in blockbusters nowadays, the newest PotC movie included. The comedy is just sort of crammed in there to ensure forced levity. It makes it so that any dramatic moments feel like they have no weight to them. I like the Black Pearl not because it knew when *not* to take itself seriously, but because it knew when it *should*. The comedy works AND the dramatic moments also work in that movie.",Karlzone

In the 3rd movie he's reduced (OUT of nowhere) to just a guy horny for the Super-woman-voodoo chick; what could have been a Faust-esque battle of wits between pirates and Satan (the deceivest humans vs the deceivest entity), was shrunk down to a super-villain battle. Meh.

Agreed. This is perfectly cemented by how they treated the Jack Sparrow character. You all know what I mean. He went from so clever and insane, that the audience questions whether he's just insane or incredibly clever or both, to comedic relief. The fact that he controls the plot and the catalyst for the events unfolding while the audience and the other characters figure this out is what made that character brilliant. Disney failed to figure that out, and assumed it's because of the wacky hi-jinks and his goofy mannerisms alone.

> At this point, The Franchise is just that, a franchise. Maybe someone will come along with an interesting tale in that universe. I hope so.

The only way they pull it off is if the original creators have a proper story to tell or another talented crew has a brilliant idea for the universe. It will never work if Disney puts the cart before the horse; lays out a release date and tells whoever they hire to rush to meet that deadline.

And all throughout the franchise the producers were clearly convinced that these movies' likability hinged on focusing on a pair of young lovers, yet I don't know anyone who thinks that Will/Elizabeth or Philip/Syrena or Henry/Carina (I had to look up 4 of these names) added anything to the movie.

The 5th one is actually kind of interesting if you look at the movie as a metaphor for Johnny Depp's career, watching young, clever Jack Sparrow become a pathetic old drunk who can't be bothered to make an effort.",

A good example is The Big Bang Theory, which could be renamed the Sheldon show. They discovered one character polled as more popular than the rest so they made him more prominent and extreme but ended up ruining the balance. 

This also happens with directors. When the Hateful Eight came out I was nervous, because I knew Tarantino had become popular enough and had made enough movies that he was at risk of being less creative, and more focused on what he knew historically worked and made him popular.

(thanks dvd commentary) 
I think because of this, the writers didn't write Jack in the sequels Like he was originally conceived, but as he was ultimately portrayed, loosing some of what made him so fun in the original.
Fun fact: the script was based off of another script that writers had been working on for some time. A Monkey Island movie. Which really explains alot when you think about it

But then again, a badly-written character is just a badly-written character, sometimes those shifts work wonderfully (like in TV when from season to season characters get thrown into different roles ) Another example is WOLVERINE / Logan and Deadpool. DP should, by all accounts, be a supporting character in the X-Men MOVIES (i read the comics, I know he's got his own books so that doesn't matter) but the point is that in X-Men Origins he's comic-relief.

I was talking about At World's End. Curse is included in the qualifier ""since Lion King"", because it came before the third movie, shockingly.

Uh, so you're admitting it's horribly written?

A lot of people say that in the second and third one he becomes a bloated caricature of himself, but I don‚Äôt think so at all (although he kind of is in the 4th one and COMPLETELY is in the 5th one). Throughout Dead Mans chest, jack is manipulating everyone and scheming to accomplish his own ends, just like in the first one. The difference in this one is the characters are more daring and assertive when it comes to dealing with him (The whole fight for the key is the perfect example not to mention IMO one of the greatest adventure/action sequences ever). Same with the third when he strikes his deal with Beckett, or battles Jones for the chest, or steals the map from Barbossa. I love the fact that none of the characters have some real unspoken bond (for the most part) because they are pirates after all. Like in the Chest when they‚Äôre trying to escape the cannibals and each cage with the crew is racing to the Pearl, perfectly content to leave the others behind. Or when Will is content to let Norrington kill Jack, or when Elizabeth and the two pirate guys (I forget their names) are about to fight, but are suddenly on each others side when the Dutchman crew shows up.

How did Ching Shih come to power? After working in a brothel and marrying her pirate husband, she took his spot atop a commanding fleet when he died, a la Elizabeth Swan.

So while I agree that her character was pretty meh (for me at least) I tend to favor her rising as a historical nod.",tsuolakussa

For one, watching him become a privateer in the King's employ while knowing he has zero allegiance to the men who served him was actually a nice dynamic.

I would even argue that the number is actually far higher than back when Black Pearl released, because of the huge success of superhero movies since. Pretty much all franchises don't nowadays, including Marvel, DC, Mission Impossible, Jurassic World, Star Wars, etc.

I agree with you. But those movies still feel very different. I agree with you that the comedy feels crammed in there, forced at times and then they try to be serious the next minute. Take the pacman moment from GOTG2 or the dance moment in the last fight in GOTG1. I never liked GOTG much personally. I feel like the comedy gets predictable after a while. They're more like Pirates of the Caribean 4+ for me.  As in the latter Pirates films Jack Sparrow becomes a bit too much. They sacrifice his serious side for more ""comedic moments"". 

This reminds me as well of when I compare The Office US to Brooklyn Nine Nine. The Office was ridiculous at times but the character still had a real and serious side. While Brooklyn Nine Nine sacrifices the serious and realistic side of characters, to create more comedic moments. The issue is that it's just cheap jokes in the end and gets old real quick. While The Office US could still maintain a coherent narrative with realistic characters while still being fun.

So maybe it's a result of the times changing, huh? I don't know.",

Firstly, the EITC was a trade cartel that ""pirated"" ships themselves and toppled governments and set up colonies in the name of profit. Imagine the most ruthless company you know, with navies and armies to back them up in anything they wanted to do.

Second...A large number of pirates were escaped naval sailors. At the time, Britain's navy was not so voluntary. Press gangs would roam the streets, beating people up and kidnapping them to crew ships. You'd wake up at sea and congratulations, you're in the navy.

This is also the reason beer typically comes in glasses nowadays. Recruiting officers would go to bars and buy rounds, and slip a shilling into the bottom. Once you accepted the drink, you ""took the king's shilling"" (your first pay check) and were now in the navy. Glass-bottomed vessels were initially a way to curb this practice.

So this practice often lead to mutiny. And if you mutinied, you were dead if you were ever caught. So crews that rose up against their captors were de facto pirates, having committed murder and hijacked something that was *insanely* expensive, and they had to continue that path to survive. That's the origin of many buccaneers.

Then there were privateers. Governments like those of Britain, France and Spain routinely authorised individuals to plunder ships of rival nationalities, offering a license legitimising it in return for a cut of the goods.",redwall_hp

This is what I mean by understanding the time period and competing interests. The East India Company was a private company by this time period, that had been sanctioned by two governments. The company had become greedy and some what irresponsible, because they were now challenging the very governments who sanctioned them in more than a few places. Keep in mind that at some point pirates worked for the British, French, Dutch and Spanish governments against each other. Then you have the pirates just trying to survive as independents.  

Then comes all the love stories. Will for his father. Will for Elizabeth, Davey for Calypso, in that I hate you so much bitch, that I love you way.

This is exactly why I'm concerned about the upcoming Solo film. Like Jack, Han is a character who works best when he's playing off the main characters, whether that be Luke and Leia or Finn and Rey.  Characters like Jack and Han are great in chunks, but spending 2+ hours with characters like that can really mess with the tone of a film. ",_Ishmael

And the trick of great shows is that they consciously keep everything in balance as long as they can.  *The Simpsons* maintained this for the better part of 8-9 seasons.  *Seinfeld* goes down as perhaps the greatest sitcom ever specifically because of the balance maintained between the lead four.

At some point, I believe they realized that Kramer would naturally steal the whole show and started working to make sure that didn't happen.  Kramer just had that right mix of charisma, a well-written character, comic timing, and exceptional comedic acting that threatened to make him a dominant force.  To Larry David and Seinfeld's credit, they kept him in check and the show was better for it.",

Tarantino is a fantastic filmmaker but you can see where his love of film starts to overshadow his ability to *make* a film. Weinstein typically let Tarantino make the movies he wanted to make because he works under budget and relatively quickly with high returns. But you can start to see where Tarantino starts to get 'excessive' with two and half hour to three hour run times and larges chunks of dialogue/character that don't do anything to purpose the film itself. Its just Tarantino kinda getting off on his own script.

They managed to highlight Malcolm while allowing other characters to have their own stories. It wasn't all about how the characters reacted to Malcolm, it often could be entirely separate stories. They pretty well avoided making the show just a caricature of itself the way Big Bang Theory does. 

I think Star Trek did this well on the dramatic side, too. The original series focuses on Kirk quite a bit, but TNG and further spinoffs do a decent job splitting the workload between characters and telling their stories as much as they do the Captain's. ",jordanjay29

However, I think those are minor and understandable problems/difficulties that I could more easily overlook if I didn't sort of hate the characters.

My favorite Jack Sparrow moment is actually from the fourth one (in fact it's the only thing from that movie I like) when he escapes from the palace.

If we're talking about the original meaning of the word that the ancient Greeks used, it's super simple: the lead actor, the one with the most screen time, is Orlando Bloom. 

If we're talking about it in the more modern sense, in the way that Syd Field, Robert McKee, Blake Snyder, William Goldman, or Steven King have written about the concept, the protagonist is the character that drives the movie's plot forward. 

In the first movie, that character is Will:

Will's inciting incident determines the arc of the film, and the resolution of his storyline is the film's resolution as well. Jack Sparrow is a support character because no matter how important he is to the film (and in a well-written film, every speaking role should be important because why else are they eating precious screen time?) it is not his story. It is Will's. 

I agree that the movie belongs to Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp. He stole every frame he was dropped into, unquestionably, and that is why he was placed front and center of every movie thereafter. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who didn't think Johnny Depp was the best part of the movie. That doesn't change the fact that the Jack Sparrow character is, in the first film, a supporting role.

There was even a deleted scene that reveals they hired Jack Sparrow to transport a shipment, and when he discovered the cargo was human slaves he released them. Freeing the slaves is what set Sparrow on the wrong side of the law and led him to piracy.

> There was a goblin, or a trickster, or a warrior. A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies. The most feared being in all the cosmos. And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it. One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world...

The Doctor has built up this reputation of being the most dangerous thing in the universe, but half the time it comes down to dumb luck. Even when he's trying to be a manipulative chessmaster, like in the Sylvester McCoy stories, he often misses something important and has to improvise a new solution.

Some stories, like *The Parting of the Ways* and *The Face of Evil*, also have the Doctor return to places where he's been before, only to find that his previous actions actually ended up leading to even worse oppression than before.

This line from Peter Capaldi's episode *Death in Heaven* sums the Doctor up pretty well, I think. He's spent the whole series questioning if he's been a good man or not, and comes to this conclusion:

> ""I am *not* a good man! I am not a bad man. I am not a hero. And I'm definitely not a president. And no, I'm not an officer. Do you know what I am? I... am... an idiot! With a box and a screwdriver. Just passing through, helping out, learning.""",protomenfan200x

>Regardless about whether a time turner was involved giving him confidence, he still cast that Patronus completely on his own.

Regardless about whether he cast that patronus ""on his own"", a time turner was still involved giving him literally unshakeable confidence, something that would allow nearly *anyone* to cast a patronus. 

In fact, before using the time turner, Harry failed completely to repel the dementors with his patronus on the shore of the lake, showing explicitly that the time turner hack is the reason he could pull it off. ‚ÄúI knew I could do it all this time, because I'd already done it"". If not for the time turner hack he'd be dead. 

>When Ron and Hermione are trying to convince him to lead the DA he says all kinds of things to downplay his abilities. They consider him much more skilled than he considers himself.

Just because they think he's more skilled doesn't mean he is. He doesn't say things to downplay his ability, he explains that he lucked and hacked his way through it, which is the truth. Ron comes to understand this in book 7:

'Getting the sword. Finishing off the Horcux. Saving my life.'¬†

I've got a few theories about the various mechanics and consequences of this whole area of magical theory, but 

1) the horcrux-making just locks part of the soul away to use it as an anti-death anchor, it's *murder* that splits the soul, which means Voldemort's soul likely resembles a whole roll of toilet paper separated into individual squares, all flapping around like confused bats or something, and

2) Voldemort started making horcruxes with his first few murders, which means the pieces he locked away in them were a lot bigger fractions of his whole self than any of the later ones. 

In fact, his *first* murder (Moaning Myrtle) got made into his first horcrux (the diary), meaning that there's half of him locked away already. His second horcrux, the ring, was done after he'd just committed three more murders (his father and paternal grandparents), so that was another third or so of the half that was left, and the murder of old Hepzibah Smith in order to horcruxify either the locket or the cup would have been quite likely the next one on.

Assuming that the soul fragment that goes into the horcrux is one-half the freshest, made-for-the-purpose split each time, and assuming that the largest soul fragment present splits with each new murder, he was probably at this point done with the major damage of losing large parts of himself to horcruxes, but the damage of shredding his soul into mass-murder confetti is likely pretty significant as well. These soul fragments would have a *volume* that likely contributed to his consciousness being greater than that of any of the later horcruxes, but I would guess that his consciousness and his connection to reality are, at this point, impressively shattered, and I find it likely that the stray piece that split off with Lily's murder latched onto Harry because it was confused enough to mistake Harry for the rest of itself (perhaps helped by the fact that, after the Killing Curse backfired from Harry, Harry's was the only soul present in the room).

It's also possible that due to that reaction, ONLY the largest fragment that most housed Voldemort's consciousness managed to hang onto that tether and not vanish into the afterlife, or only six or so (whatever number of horcruxes he had made at that point) pieces managed it, each of them grabbing at one of the existing horcruxes to stay on the mortal plane and scrambling his consciousness so much that it took him over a decade to recover even to the point of managing to talk to someone like Quirrell.

Note that Harry is so viscerally repulsed by the soul fragment's representation that he cannot bring himself to touch it, and Dumbledore states with finality that it is beyond help; I'm thinking this was due to more than Voldemort's evilness, but that it is too small and shredded to function as a person on its own, sort of the equivalent of scraping up a pound or so of pulped flesh with a bit of recognizable spleen in it after a bad car accident and trying to restore a living person out of it; with its physical host, it can be an anchor for Voldemort's consciousness, but without that, it is nothing.

But, anyway, point being is, I'm pretty sure the soul fragment inside Harry was nowhere near an eighth.",Cypraea

Yes, he HELMS it and it's because of him that they make big bucks, but his character is just laughable nowadays. I actually really love the fantasy seafaring world with magic, monsters, curses and so on! All of that was really right up my alley. I loved the idea of a pirate council and them banding together in the third one for example. That shit appeals to me. However, Johnny Depp drunkenly stumbling from set piece to set piece and basically being Bugs Bunny with bad breath just.. makes these fun, awesome, swooping movies into something awkward. The last two movies were quite cool, but whenever Depp entered the stage I felt Fremdscham. The jokes weren't even on point most of the time. They felt like a machine was trying to compute a funny joke and they came up with some prat falls and woopsiedaisy-i-am-so-drunk-but-it-works-out-anyways moments.

At least the initial movie and the sequel had Johnny Depp playing a confident, cocky alcoholic, who sometimes stumbles into fortune, but most of the time has a clear picture and a plan. His death in the second one was great for that for example. He never intended to die on the ship. Elizabeth finally adopted one of his ploys and tricked him, before he could trick her/them. And he took it with some amount of grace and even a fake heroic smile just to play up a non-existent ""yep, totally sacrificing myself for the good of the group!"" narrative.

The recent interpretation of Jack Sparrow has almost none of that. He's just a bumbling, stumbling idiot that gets incredibly lucky and isn't even very relevant to the entire plot of the fifth Pirates movie! I was far more interested and invested in basically every other character. 

Either make Sparrow into a dashing, smart rogue with a golden heart and a penchant for booze again, or remove him from the franchise and give room to some other characters. ",OnlyRoke

The 2nd one was pretty good, but really more of the same of the first one. You could tell they found a formula that worked and just made it again in a different setting but still, memorable characters and a fairly solid if not a little too goofy of a script with too many one liners.

Sparrow was intended to be a swashbuckling, Errol Flynn type character, a loveable rogue whose talent was never really in question. If you think about the events of the movie you can still see it : we're never really given any reason to doubt Sparrow's ability. Everything he attempts to do he succeeds at. Had they played it straight like it was intended the movie would still work. But Depp's decision to play it with a touch of madness (which the studio was firmly against) worked perfectly, because the result is despite Sparrow's continual success you're never entirely sure if he's just lucky or really that good.

Unfortunately, once the role was a huge success, they started writing the movies around Depp and his portrayal, which ruins it. His lunacy becomes baked into the world, which means the rest of the movie has to go over the top to match and he no longer stands out.

1) The script(its a seriously underrated one), performances(oscar worthy), visuals(cgi still holds up), music(iconic), action sequences(so well executed) are nothing short of great.

2) The story, while simple, is complex enough to keep viewers guessing till the end, and resolves itself fairly well.

3) The film offers so many memorable and lovable characters. Sparrow, Barbossa, Gibbs etc.

4) The film, though a fantasy, has barely any plot holes or inconsistencies. Whatever world the film presents, the plot stays within the presented plausibility. 

5) The film does a great job in mixing humor with drama, which makes it accessible to people for all age groups.

6) It is well agreed upon that the film holds up 14 years later on, and there is little doubt that it would age very well moving forward.

7) A lot of memorable one liners.

8) Excellent music. 

9) Its in the IMDb 250, and has decent to great critic + audience scores on all forums.

The writing and dialogue definitely took a hit compared to the first 2, but since it was an immediate sequel to the second (which was an immediate sequel to the first), I watch it as though they are all one consolidated movie.

Raiders is in my top 5 movies of all time and is probably the movie I've rewatched the most. I like curse too but I see Raiders vs Last Crusade more as a discussion than Curse vs Raiders.

Raiders is nearly a perfect movie, it has great casting with Harrison Ford playing Indiana Jones and Paul Freeman as Belloq. The story is well written and if you watch the trilogy in chronological order story is even better, because it is not only about the adventures but also about Indianas character growth and evolution throughout these adventures. 

The Pirates theme is good but the Raiders March is just something else. Even the mysterious theme that is playing when you see the Ark is just amazing.

The argument I can make for Last Crusade is the Sean Connery factor. Indy's father is James Bond and the dynamic between them makes it so much fun to watch.

movies,wt5uq2,The definitive adventure movie: Raiders of the Lost Ark or Curse of the Black Pearl?,il2a3lz,2022-08-20 13:12:42,"The Last Crusade. :D

For some reason, I never clicked with either film. I mean, I enjoy both of them but they're hardly my favourite movies - I guess maybe swashbucklers aren't really my thing.

Curse of the Black Pearl is assuredly the more large-scale of the two: it takes place on the high seas and there are some pretty big setpieces, where Raiders is smaller, more quaint but in its own way all the more impressive with stuff like that truck chase. I really don't know: it doesn't help that I didn't watch either of them in quite a while.

I wrote it in jest, but in terms of more swashbuckling kind of adventure films, I really do think my favourite is The Last Crusade. This kind of materia lends itself better towards more overt comedy, but there's also some really moving beats there thanks to the father-son dynamic.

And you're right, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings don't belong in this discussion: not just because of their fantasy trappings, but also because of the saga quality that they both ultimately have.",Chen_Geller

LotR is entirely fantasy from start to finish, being set in an entirely fictional world with fictional races and languages, magic and magical creatures, etc. The fantasy components comprise the entire world, except for the medieval human race, basically.

Pearl and Raiders characters are based in the real world, where the fantasy elements of the stories are supernatural compared to everything else.

However, if we're just looking at the original trilogy, or even just the P1 The Curse of the Black Pearl by itself, one could argue that it's Will and Elizabeth's story. If we're going to go further with having just one character being the protagonist, there is just as much argument to be made about Elizabeth being the main protagonist just as it is for Will. Even the screenwriters stick with the idea that it was intended to be Elizabeth's story, which makes some sense, given they start the first film with her singing ""Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)"" at the beginning and later gave her the title of Pirate King half-way through P3 At World's End.

With all that in mind, it irks me to this day how they treated the characters after the trilogy. Say what you will about P4 On Stranger Tides and P5 Dead Men Tell No Tales as films, and some have made arguments about Jack's characterization both on paper and onscreen, some I agree with but mainly on P5 side of the criticism. Not to say P4 was perfect, but it was fairly less flawed in comparison.

But getting back to Will and Elizabeth, they were literally brought back for the sake of being brought back. No substance in their roles and it certainly did not live up to the hype it was given upon the announcement of Orlando Bloom's return. Will was reduced to a cameo at the beginning and end of P5, with only Luke Skywalker's The Force Awakens being worse. And Elizabeth had zero lines in the one minute role she had. Adding insult to injury, P5 ruined a fairly decent end set up by P3: instead of Will serving aboard the Flying Dutchman for 10 years, it was pretty much 20+ years. Insulting to anyone who's followed the films since the beginning and actually did the proper research as far as Will and Elizabeth's fates as of the end of the original trilogy.",CJS-JFan

movies,u9smxr,Is there any doubt over who's the main protagonist of The Curse of the Black Pearl?,jztq2xv,2023-09-09 15:26:57,"Thanks for sharing this. I somehow never watched the movie back in the day, and me and my wife watched it last night. I'd seen a few of the famous scenes, but just short bits and pieces. Who knows why, I was 13 when it came out so maybe i just thought I was too edgy to watch a stupid movie about ghost pirates. Anyway, I fucking loved it. A+. And some of Depp's best work.

So when we got to the end, I was like, okay between the 3 main heroes who was technically the protagonist? I was an English major in college and my literature brain was saying, if I had to pick one, it's Elizabeth Swann. That's why I found this thread, I was looking for more people discussing the idea of who the protagonist is really or in a more technical sense.

Sure, Will drives a lot of the action. And I agree Jack is more of a catalyst than a driver of the plot. But, Elizabeth isn't a passive maiden. The story starts with her and she makes a lot of important choices that move the plot. And, she gets what she wanted in the end. None of those things individually are even really necessary to make her *the* protagonist, but it helps make the point. It is her story.

The comparisons to Star Wars are kind of tiring and an oversimplification. Sure, there are some major similarities, but it's a different story. And just because one character gets captured and has to be rescued by another, doesn't determine who is the protagonist or a supporting character. It's possible for protagonists to get into situations where they are in a passive role, as long as the story is *about* them. If that wasn't true, then who would be the protagonist of *Forrest Gump*?

movies,u9smxr,Is there any doubt over who's the main protagonist of The Curse of the Black Pearl?,i5uw0gl,2022-04-23 08:57:31,"I said it was at best an ensemble, because it can be argued that Will is still the main character in Dead Man's Chest. After all, his wedding is interrupted, and his motivation to remedy this interruption and get his wife out of jail drives his actions in the film. A great deal of plot priority is given to Jack in this film, and his troubles with Davy Jones, but I can concede that viewing it as an ensemble film is not inaccurate. Once you get to At World's End, however, the protagonist ball is firmly in Jack's court. While the first 20 minutes or so of the film doesn't feature Jack, it doesn't really feature any strong protagonists either. The familiar characters are there, but none of them take the lead in the story, and it doesn't feel like the story is being viewed from any single perspective. Once Jack is rescued, it's almost as much of a Jack Sparrow film as the next two films. Nobody really cares about the Will/Elizabeth love story (should they? With all the convoluted plot mess... one could almost say that Pirates should've stopped at one film). It's all about Jack and his thing with Davy. A side story to keep Will relevant is Bootstrap, but it only serves to keep Will as a character interested in what's going on. From a story perspective, what interest do Will and Elizabeth have in rescuing Jack from the Locker? They could run away and get married at the end of Dead Man's Chest. Will stays because he needs to resolve the whole ""father on the Dutchman"" ordeal, and Elizabeth stays because she supports Will and also feels guilty about killing Jack.

Will is spurred to action to save his wife, but she is freed shortly after. At almost any point in Dead Man's Chest's endgame, they could have just said ""fuck it"" and run off to live happily ever after. The only thing keeping Will invested in Jack's story is his father. Every other plot element is about Jack and Davy.",Danielnrg

I recommend finding and listening to that screenwriter's commentary.  If I remember right, they were all on the same track together, even tho they all worked on different drafts over the years.  I also remember how much they all loved what Depp did with the character they created, taking it to a new level.

I'm glad you found this discussion and that it helped.

If you're a real English major and a Shakespeare fan, you might be interested in the 80s comedy Strange Brew featuring the McKenzie Brothers.  You can look it up for more info but the reason I mention it is, when I studied Hamlet I recognized the plot from that movie, which was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid.  The McKenzie Bros are basically the Rosencrantz & Guildenstern of the film.  Nobody but me seems to care (my English teacher gave me a disinterested smile when I told her), so I'm taking a shot that an English major might get a kick out of seeing it.

Also, I wouldn't call Forrest passive.  He was running.  And his running made it all happen.  Running literally and thematically.  If he didn't run, he wouldn't have gotten a football scholarship, his platoon would have died, everything that happens is because he was running.  And Jenny was running away.",

I do want to say, its not unusual for the focus in a movie to shift between entries in a trilogy or series, nor is it necessarily a bad thing, either.

For instance, we technically think of Frodo (and/or Sam) as the main character of *The Lord of the Rings*. But *The Two Towers* is much more focused on the Aragorn/Rohan storyline, simply because it has the most interesting plot developments and setpieces within that stretch of the overall narrative; and **most audiences just  accept it and roll with it.**",Chen_Geller

Jack Sparrow is not a dispensable part of the story, where it can work out the same way without him, but he is not the focus of the story.

The focus is how Will (and Elizabeth) fit into this mythical tale. Jack's role in the ordeal (most of which doesn't occur on film, and adds to his mystique) is not the focus of the story. If anything, it allows him to serve as an exposition dumper to the audience. Another way to look at it is that the protagonist is often the person who knows the least about what is going on. The protagonist rarely gets any opportunity to flex their intimate knowledge about what is going on, because an important aspect of the protagonist is that the audience can easily identify with or picture themselves as the protagonist.

I would like to keep the tradition, but life changes generation to generation.  I believe Mr. DEPP put his heart and soul into making these Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Aside from politics, making another Pirates of the Caribbean movie, without Mr. Johnny Depp, would be a waste of time. He was an absolutely great character, even spent his personal time dressing up at hospital's, and Disney Land, to give many people joy.

There's no reason we should be going backwards in terms of CGI quality, but between Ant-Man 3 and The Flash, CGI is looking rough on some of these films when it shouldn't.  It's not the artists' fault, they aren't given suffient time/resources to finish the shots and when every 2nd shot (or every shot) needs CGI, you're hooped.

You're spending $140-200 million making these movies, what is another 10-20 mil to get quality CG work done and you're movie doesn't look like shit.  Also, the quality of these scripts is pretty poor.",JPeeper

And maybe they sometimes think to give them more time and creative freedom to films they deem to be ‚Äòmore important‚Äô in the larger scheme of things.   Such as pushing crossovers and cameos, giver tighter deadlines to vfx artists on a film, knowing it will hurt the quality of the film, in order to rush it out this season and set up something further down the pipeline where they can pay off the setup, or branch off to new franchises, or really focus on the quality of vfx on a ‚Äòmore important‚Äô film.  Knowing when to pull their top vfx houses and artists to work on projects further down the pipeline and knowing these things might hurt the individual film but not enough so that they‚Äôll loose audience interest when they pay it off further down the line in other projects.     
  
These types of decisions happen all the time.  So I‚Äôm wondering if there is ever consideration given to how much ‚Äògoodwill‚Äô so to speak, you have with your audience before you start negatively impacting the perception and interest in the larger franchise as a whole.

> Oftentimes they are trying to appeal to different groups outside their normal fan base and in doing so hit the wrong tone for their long time fans.  
  
This is actually a good example of a situation where those orders to appeal to larger audience or do things like ‚Äòtry to capture all four quadrants‚Äô at the expense of long time fans, might very well not be the ideas of the writer/s themselves but from producers or executives from the studio demanding those criteria be met and it might not necessarily be something the writer wants to do but needs to if they want to have a job.

In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3.

They weren't perfect, not even as good as the first film which was a fun adventure film at best, but they both had something that the latter sequels were sorely missing; ambition. You can tell that the writers and director were truly swinging for the fences and even if they missed more often than not, at least they tried. The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind. Elizabeth's speech, the maelstrom, the fights, the wedding in the middle of the fights, all with some epic Hans Zimmer music, and then the cherry on top of the destruction of Beckett's ship in slow motion.

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top.

Maybe its just because I hated the third film so much but I found *On Stranger Tides* refreshing; the ending scene also concludes Jack's story arch involving his search for immortality.

The first three are solid narratively because of the two leads:  Elizabeth and Will. They both have goals and drive and great character development.

Jack is not a main character. He is a plot device. A really damned good plot device, but his character is not suited to serving as the primary protagonist.

It wasn't just two sides, one trying to destroy it, one defending it, but lots of different characters having different motivations to do either. The amount of planning, crossing, double crossing, making deals, breaking them, stealing, buying, hiding, finding, made it really interesting to follow and try and work out the best outcome for everyone.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

It was a mostly normal and mortal world, and then had this one out of place fantasy element with the cursed pirates to give it a twist. In Curse of the Black Pearl the pirates were just pirates--normal people being debaucherous in Tortuga, in At World's End the pirates are part of a mystical society that can summon an ocean god with a semi-spiritualistic death hymn. If you look up ""jumping the shark,"" the first result should be this movie trilogy.

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work."" But then Elizabeth was like ""are you fucking kidding me? All this effort gone to waste? Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.  
  
It was intended to be a ""What now?"" scene. You don't need a goddess giving you buffs beforehand. All you need is a fighting spirit and a reason to fight and you damn well fight to the last breath!

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

Professor Hulk being the one to do the snap, there fore kind of fullfilling the idea tony had in avengers 1, that Banner was given this power for a reason. Thats the crux of and climax of his story.

on the other hand the kraken is just 100% killed and it never affects anything ever again after being this massive doomsday plot device in movie 2",dejerik

Studio comedies had some high highs and low lows but the overall movement away from adult comedies that could be smart and mature to juvenile/crass/profane was unsustainable in the long run and now we don't get many good rom coms or regular romances. Mainstreaming ""indie"" as a genre instead of a budget category resulted in tons of lacklaster efforts. Similarly, the trends in VFX-driven franchises blockbusters culminating in the MCU, HP, etc, destroyed the mid-budget adult movie. We're only now starting to see these categories of filmmaking return in a profitable, widely-accessible way.

I remember there were this specific type of Leather Vest that Jessica wore, it have ""Net Pattern"" and I found a Male version online but sadly, Global Shipping wasn't a thing then...

And I fell in love with Tactical Army Combat Boots and still my favorite boots. As well Jensen's Black & Brown Leather Jacket, he also sometime wore this Blue-ish/Black Turtleneck Wool Knit Sweater.

And my hometown was a ""Fishermen"" town and we do have turtleneck wool sweater as well Leather Jacket, Pants... Because we're also kind of Red-neck Bikers type of town with lots of Gangs, so cowboy boots, high-neck boots & leather jacket was a thing too...

But I didn't that what we had back then, was a Local-factory Made products. It wasn't anything fancy or high end!

I searched high & low for identical vest, jacket, sweater & boots... Practically spend months, maybe a year, I don't remember... Even went as far as printing ""Wanted Posters"" and went from shop to shop, ask every Shop Owner to help find those... Literally, it was a ""Mission"" for me.

I was somehow.... THAT DESPERATE to get those!!! Because I was & still am, a collectors of any favorite things of mine that I could get my hands on.

Looking back now... it's stupid & silly... because I live in a 3rd-world poor country... Even now, we still don't have anything of high-end fashion on local store... But luckily, I was able to order some from Amazon & other online store from overseas. And I still have them, they are still New & Well Packed in my Trophy Room.

A series... called Sheena...  
  
It's about a woman who raised & learned magic from a Witch and transformed into animals at will. And she often transform into this a Black Leopard but sometime, she did a Hybrid Form of it, Werewolf-like and she have ""Bear-like Claws"" in this form.

I got those Claws too!!!

Back then, my country wasn't all in with the Wild Life Protection... Many locals was hunting Tigers, Bears... and various animals for food & medicine...

Wild Boar & Deer are still a local delicacy and legally allow to hunt as foods. But we now have Wild-boar Meat Farm too.

And Black-bear Paws, was the Top of Precious items... And I got a pair of them and have this local Pelt Store preserved them and turned it into a Pair of Wearable-Gloves with Claws fully attached... And I would wore them sometime in one of my stupid cosplay.

One time, I fell asleep in it and my Dad came in to check on me and he lifted the blanket off of me to adjust my covers... I was wearing bear-glove and scared the living Jesus out of him...

And, I do have my own animal farm but not for Foods, for Pet. I used to have many exotic wild animals, well... whatever that my parents allow me to keep, that including ""Peacock, Giant Tortoise, Pangolins...""

And one day, I got this Black Melanistic Version of ""Tiger-Fish"" a species of Small Tiger that hunts fishes but i believe it globally known as The Fishing Cat (Prionailurus Viverrinus), 

I raised for a year or so, it was huge, bigger than normal dog but very friendly & sweet because i raise from baby and my Dad never checked my farm, it's like a huge walled-up backyard of my mine, filled with Rare Type of Chickens...   
  
And one day, I am not sure what happened... possibly I got sick & got hospitalized...

So my Dad went in to feed animals for me... and got scared by Tiger-Fish and give me good schooling as he said the ""Tiger"" could get free & attack small children in my neighborhood. So he have people take it and released it in the mountain near its hunting places.....

Then Bird-flu came and my Dad have all birds/chicken released in mountain and I was heart broken and never keep another animal since then.

Looking back now... I was quite a handful for my parents!!!",Titi6888

movies,6llzr6,Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl vs Guardians of the Galaxy. The better film?,djus3xq,2017-07-06 14:28:26,"Pirates edges out a win for two reasons.

First the action scenes are more intricate, more complex, more whatever you want to call it.  If you look at [this scene from Guardians] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anGXdHs4ak4), there are multiple groups weaving the action between each other.  It's fun, it's well choreographed, but it doesn't really interact with its environment.  I think this is [a comparable scene in Pirates.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLumu0DcycM) where characters and their skill are being introduced.  It's more dialogue-laden, but what I'm pointing to is the movement and interaction with the environment.  We can't forget we're in a forge because they keep hitting the walls and the items in the shop and then jumping up into the rafters.  It's more captivating than just seeing the characters interact on a sidewalk with onlookers.

The second reason is a bit of a stretch, but I think Pirates works better if you cut it out of context of the rest of the movies.  It has a more complete story arc, less of a tie in to sequels and other movies in an extended universe.  I know Guardians has actually very little tie in (perhaps the least of any Marvel movie), but it's still there and it definitely does not end without an obvious sequel setup.",SaulsAll

Just like Barbossa, Jack is meant to be their guide into this world for the relatively normal or relatable main characters from the ordinary world, but in the following films they center it around Jack and Will and Elizabeth become the side characters, and he just doesn't work that way.",lemonylol

I think the main problem tho is that the first film really is a stand alone story. It didn't need sequels because once you introduced a character that awesome how do you not focus every other film on him? Disney's kinda stuck. People want more pirates but to do that you need Jack but you can't do that unless you make him the focus but if you do the character kind of falls apart. 

Jacks either really lucky which kinda gets tiring after awhile OR you have what's happening-the character starts becoming a one note parody of himself. I honestly hope this is the last film and the character is given a TV series. I think making him part of an ensemble cast and pushing him back into the background a bit would solve a lot of his current issues. ",ziddersroofurry

2) If Barbossa did not know any way out of the locker, why take such a huge risk and risk others lives as well?
3) Why did Elizabeth and Will not confront each other over a period of several weeks/months?
4) How the hell did the crabs help Jack get to the beach?
5) While the pistols are wet, the crew did not know this, and they start firing at each other. What if the pistols were not wet. How stupid is that.

2) They were running out of time to gather the Brethren Court, and everyone on board knew the danger. They had no idea what the Locker would be like and assumed it would be easier to figure out on the inside.

3) Will saw Elizabeth kiss Jack. It isn't that they didn't confront each other, it's just that with Will not knowing the cause of the kiss he became more distant and she did in turn. He mentions this to Jack later in the film.

4) Tia Dalma (Calypso) was shown to have full control over the crabs. She simply used them to lift The Black Pearl out of the barren wasteland it was stuck in and return it to the seas of the Locker.

5) They fight with wet pistols all the time, but due to being completely submerged for decent period of time, the water soaked all the powder, both in the pistol and on the ship. If the guns had worked they would have shot each other. I'm fairly certain none of them even planned to shoot until Jack shot Barbossa. Jack shooting Barbossa makes perfect sense, Jack would obviously still hate him, and Barbossa made it clear he wanted to use Jack for his own ends.

6) It's a movie? Literally a work of fiction. The first one had undead skeleton pirates. If THIS is where you draw the line, then I don't know how to help you.

7) Beckett is a man of manipulation. Very rarely does he get his hands dirty. He's all about making deals and intimidation. It was out of left field for him to suddenly find Will Turner at the wheel of the Dutchman, which was a nigh unbeatable ship. The fact that he'd been bested both physically and through business froze him up. It was evident his crew wanted to do something but Beckett had locked up.

8) It very much was touched upon. ""4 of you have tried to kill me in the past. 1 of you succeeded"". Plus it's Jack, if anything he respected Elizabeth more for finally embracing her pirate side there. Plus he was very much attracted to her.

9) I touched on this with the one about Beckett, but a large portion of the war on Pirates was through deals, blackmail, and intimidation to gain the upper hand. Plus with an invincible ship (The Flying Ductchman) on one side makes the whole battle moot. The only reason that The Dutchman didn't completely obliterate the Black Pearl was because the Pearl itself was a very powerful ship, and the conditions created by Calypso (The Maelstrom) kept it in the fight long enough for someone to stab the heart.

I understand if you don't personally enjoy the movie, and I'll agree that it's very long and detail oriented, but it was very tightly written and there aren't many actual plot holes or grievances. In fact the only one I can spot is Beckett assuming his men still had control of the Dutchman after it went underwater in the Maelstrom. But even that one isn't immersion breaking and can be chalked up to heat of the moment cockiness.",-OrangeLightning4

I think one of the biggest problems (that each Pirates movie built on) is the development of the three main characters. In Curse, Jack is not the main protagonist. He‚Äôs the sidekick foil to Will. And yes, he does have some goofy moments, but in Curse he‚Äôs much more of a clever, conniving character. Each movie subsequently made him dumber, goofier, and more clearly ‚Äúthe main character‚Äù. Will is the traditional hero of Curse, going through a hero arc and realizing that pirates aren‚Äôt all bad. He‚Äôs stubborn and naive, but also caring and brave. The sequels mostly just have him around for action and the ‚Äúsave Dad vs marry Elizabeth‚Äù choice. Elizabeth gets more of an arc in the sequels, but they don‚Äôt build much on her initial character. She remains stubborn, headstrong, and adventurous, while getting into more and more crazy situations. Honestly, Norrington and Davy Jones have the best character development in the sequels.

Pirates 1 motivations are pretty straight forward:

* Jack: Wants the Black Pearl and generally money
* Will: Wants to save Elizabeth
* Norington: Wants to save Elizabeth and marry her
* Barbossa & Crew: Wants the curse lifted

Pirates 2 and 3 motivations get a lot more complex and alliances shift over the course of the films:

* Jack: Wants to get out of his deal with Davy Jones and never die
* Will: Wants to get his dad back from Davy Jones
* Elizabeth: Wants a pardon so they can live happily ever after
* Davy Jones: Just doing his job and pissed at Calypso
* Norington: Wants to get his station back and regain honor
* Gibbs & Crew: Wants to survive and make $
* Bootstrap Bill: Wants to save his son
* Capt Feng: Wants to release Calypso
* Tia Dalma: Wants to be released I guess

I fully agree with the OP. Dead Man‚Äôs Chest, with its mixture of foolhardy swashbuckling, high stakes drama and double crossing, is unmatched. Definitely the high point of the entire Pirates franchise. It‚Äôs three cheers from me!",deltakeeper

Bootstrap Bill gave a frightening tale to Jack that this man has the *Kraken* working for him, of all things. If the Reaper of the seas is coming to collect your soul, he'll be intimidating for sure. It's a lot of work to get a CGI character right, and in 2006 they did a phenomenal job. Thinking about it now, just two years later we got the first Iron Man, and I still love the CGI in that movie. I know with how complicated the MCU is now, they basically made Iron Man's last suit iterations nanotech and much more ""fluid"" so that the CGI would probably be simpler, but I really love going back and seeing how much effort went into the first suit (I'm pretty sure they made an actual model of his suit), and the weight felt pretty believable.

*At World's End* is clearly a conclusion. Just like *Return of the Jedi* is a conclusion, or like how *Matrix Revolutions* is a conclusion. You shouldn't have yet another sequel after the conclusion.

Some movies aren't resolutions in the usual sense, but are a kind of good farewell to the characters, like *Toy Story 3* or *The Last Crusade*, and yet they too get further sequels.

In the first film, all of those characters' subplots all tied into the central plot. While they do in the sequel, as well, that central plot is more a MacGuffin than a story. It's a bunch of independent threads coming together because of the chest, but so much of those threads requires a ton of exposition which makes the film feel overstuffed. The first film was *The Black Pearl* crew's motivation against the motivations of the other parties to save Elizabeth (Will and Norrington) or save their ship (Jack and the other pirates) - since those opposing Barbosa all have a goal that lends to each other, it flows so much more naturally. 

In *Dead Man's Chest*, it's ""I wanna free my Daddy,"" ""I wanna save my fianc√© (even though I'm doubting I want to),"" ""I'm not sure what I want, but I wanna not be killed by the Kraken,"" ""I don't want these fuckers to stab my heart,"" and ""I'm not sure what I want, but, hey, everyone else wants this thing, so I must want it too."" No one really shares any motivations, so it's a juggle. This movie starts the clusterfuck of backstabbing that makes the cup flow over in the third film. It's all engineered drama, where the first excelled at the characters' all sharing a motivation while having different goals - the sequel is different goals *and* different motivations, but driven to claim the same solution. It just doesn't land as well.",axlkomix

It's a slow burn as you follow Graysmith into the depths of obsession against a background of murder and a bizarre cat and mouse game with the police and the killer. It is slow, but it is deliberate. 

On the other hand, my favorite Star Wars movie, RotJ, is also long, and generally not slow, until you get to Endor and things basically stop progressing for about 30 minutes while they fuck around in the forest.

To me, Pirates 4 felt like a continuation that was at least hinted at after At World's End. I know it's hard for the movie to feel as much like a Pirates movie because the trilogy was wrapped up nicely and ended some important character arcs. It's a good thing they didn't bring them back (looking at you 5), but at the same time I can't deny I'm biased with 4 because I'm a fan of Barbossa.

I know everyone loves Jack Sparrow but I personally loved Hector Barbossa more as a character. He just feels like the most pirate-y pirate out of them all, and in a way Pirates 4 is basically seeing Barbossa go through the same arc Jack did in the first Pirates movie. We don't see him reduced to something weak, instead we see Barbossa conquering his newfound weakness and going for revenge against a notoriously feared pirate. I just loved seeing Barbossa win again, killing Blackbeard and taking the magical sword and ship for his own purposes.",HussyDude14

> I have to assume he was thrown off his last boat for whatever reason and Port Royal was simply the closest place to where he was thrown off.

That makes sense. He did have a sinking dinghy at the start so maybe he was out of options other than to make a stop at Port Royal and find another boat. What so you, Jack was up to before coming to Port Royal? Living the pirate's life?

> Jack's a rock star. People like that never think that Death can happen to them. And if they do, they don't show it.

That's again a good reason. To build on this, at this point Jack was kinda miserable. no ship, no crew to command, just scraping by on small boats. With pirates dying left and right under British naval command, death is always around the corner and its not as if Jack was living a very enviable life at that point.

> Yeah, he was trying keep Swann safe.

Did he care enough for her? It makes sense he would have her locked up since he expected some of the undead crew to get on the Dauntless. My reading was so that Swann doesn't escape or make a rash decision that hampers Jack's plans.

> They kept to the code. But, at the end, they recognized the code as more of a set of guidelines. They say as much after they rescue him.

1) He was there for the interceptor as it is the only ship that can theoretically match the black pearl. Hence why he goes to the guards and stands aboard the ship. He didnt realise who will was until they had a conversation.

Good reason. 2 things. 1) Don't you think he should have changed into disguise since his appearance was suspicious? 2) What good is the Interceptor and catching the Pearl if he can't break the curse of the ship? Or maybe he wasn't exactly sure of the curse and is surprised when the pirates visit his cell.

2) Just his character. Hes cocky, like someone else said, hes a rockstar.

Hmm. He sure is a rockstar but since Jack does value his life quite a bit in later movies, it felt un-Jack like here. 

3) People said he cared about her, which may be true in the context of the other films. But the main one was that they had different motives no? Elizabeth wanted to save will, jack wanted revenge on barbossa. He was being the manipulative puppet master that he is to make sure she didnt interfere. Whether it eventuated to her getting involved or not is inconsequential. He perceived her as a risk big enough that she would get in the way of his revenge.

So it was less of saving her and more of her less interfering with Jack's plans? I agree there. But don't you think this convo was best had on the Dauntless rather than when they were on the smaller boats just outside the caves when Jack suggests this to Norrington?

> Bit of comic relief and pirate code as well as driving home the family values schtick that the subsequent movies followed. The crew toon flight but came back, they all shared a hug.

Really? Interesting point actually. To bargain with Barbossa if he ever finds him? yeah that is a good reason. He also assumes the son of Bill would be carrying the coin so it would easily call to the pirates.

> One or both: he knows he is the secret main character and can‚Äôt die/ he knows about the dog with the keys in its mouth and believes he can escape without harm.

Cannot come to terms with the first reason as that is a meta reason. The second one makes more sense. The other prisoners are calling the dog yet Jack is all relaxed adn tells them it is futile. I wonder what he was thinking then.

> He cares about Elizabeth.

So he wanted to lock her up for her safety? But why then send Barboosa's undead men out to sea towards the ship?

> Ghost pirates rate a higher threat than British sailors.

Good point.

I would have to disagree partly. Yes, those 2 are the MVPs of the movie but damn that script is gold. I think with that script and Verbinski's direction as well as the banging music, the film was a sure fire hit.

People like that see themselves as the lead character in whatever story they happen to be in.  He's despondent that the crew left him, but if he dies to a hangman's rope, well, he shows respect to those that did at the beginning of the movie, so he likely doesn't see that as a terrible way to go.

1. That makes sense, but keep in mind that at this stage it was still very much a movie that disney wanted accessible to kids to sell merchandise. Thats where they generate a lot of money from and is kinda their schtick. So him not being in a classic pirate get up etc may go over their heads to what he actually is. Both sides are very recognisable in the film, the royals are clean, pirates are dirty etc for that reason I would think. Also, a disguise goes against his cocky, rockstar attitude. His schtick is he doesnt really think things through but is quick on his feet and fumbles through fights and situations like a witty mr magoo. Its a huge part of his character.

The next point is I dont think he was 100% convinced that they were cursed which is why he was kind of surprised in the jail house. There were rumours, but nothing concrete on what he was dealing with. That is more thinking that the character knows what the audience knows, which isnt neccessarily true.


2. I never understood him to value his life until he was faced with certain death in dead mans chest. That was a revelation for his character and was a big part of that movies character arc and the driving force of the film in general. Even in that film he was selfish and then in no 3. He began to recognise will, elizabeth, the crew etc as people he would die for, not serve up on a silver platter to davy jones. Up till that point, all he cared about was money, booze, women and the pirate life for which I believe he even alluded to in the first film that would get the better of him one day. Maybe he was content with it.


3. True, but he saw the opportunity at that point. I never viewed him as the kind of guy who can plan things out but he is very good at reacting. That was his moment. If you apply too much logic to a movie it can seem very coincidental. I believe this might be one of those situations.  


4. Exactly. We cant be certain that at this point they were 100% doing a sequel(im sure the plans in motion were at their early stages). The movie could have flopped and it still would have been a great feel good ending for all the characters.

Nice observation. 

The thing about Jack in later movies is that he cares a lot about survival. I guess in movie 2 he has his beloved Pearl and a big crew under him so he values that life and wants to live as long as possible whereas in 1 he has got nothing to live for apparently so why even bother?

Again well summed up. Yeah in DMC is when he starts valuing life and serves a good arc for him. Before that, you are right, he was living vicariously. Just chill out and see what happens. if it's death, well it was a life well lived.
