Not to make light of its disastrous drop, but there are actually 5 films with a higher percentage drop with over 3,000 theaters.

* **Beauty and the Beast (2017)** - The Disney train just keeps on rolling as Beauty and the Beast became the 8th movie to ever pass $500M domestic. Now half of the $500M grossers are Disney films with all of them coming out in the last five years (the other three are The Force Awakens, The Avengers, and Rogue One). Disney has clearly cornered the market on domestic sales and could easily see another enter the $500M range with The Last Jedi being released later this year.

* **The Fate of the Furious** - It wasn't just Disney adding a new member to an elite club, as Universal's Fate of the Furious passed $1B in international sales this week. This is just the 6th film to do so and the first time ever two films from a franchise have passed that marker (Furious 7 also made $1B internationally). Also Fate of the Furious has now passed Iron Man 3 in worldwide gross making FotF the 11th highest grossing film of all time. 

**Films not on follow list with updates**

* **Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2** - Guardians 2 has now surpassed the original in both domestic ($333.2M) and worldwide gross ($783.3M). Now the big question is if the film will become the first non-RDJ starring MCU film to crack $1B. 

**Notable film closings**

* **Moonlight** - The very acclaimed and surprise (in more ways than one) Best Picture winner has now closed to an incredible $27.8M domestic and $65M worldwide on a budget of just $1.5M. The film was made on a shoestring budget to the point that Oscar nominee Naomi Harris literally had to film here scenes in just three days. As such the film looked to be closing around $10M or so before the Oscar buzz but nominations and awards helped propel to becoming the highest grossing release for A24, even topping films that played in twice as many theaters like Ex Machina and The VVitch. Moonlight is an undeniable success, one that proves Oscars matter in terms of getting small films like Moonlight seen by much larger audiences. 

* **Your Name** - The little anime that could closed in the US to an incredible $4.8M domestic and $354.3M worldwide on an unknown but likely small budget. The anime was a massive success in both Japan and China where it broke previous animation box office records and become something of a cultural touchstone for youths in both nations. In the US the film didn't quite catch on but it never saw a release of more than 300 theaters and maintained good per theater averages throughout its run. Ultimately US is a blip in comparison to the rest of the world, where the film was a monumental success in multiple countries. 

* **The Belko Experiment** - The latest from Blumhouse closed to a small if solid $10.1M domestic and $10.3M worldwide on a budget of $5M. The film from writer James Gunn received mix reviews but ultimately doubled its budget and likely played well in VOD which is more the goal of the BH Tilt title it was released under. It should be noted this meager sum is actually the second highest gross for BH Tilt which should tell you that meager sums is the name of the game. 

* **CHIPS** - While Baywatch is certainly gunning for it, CHIPS saw an equally awful performance closing to a pathetic $18.6M domestic and $25.5 worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film by Dax Shepard was savaged by critics and could barely even top its small production budget and will almost certainly be a loss Warner Bros. when marketing is counted in. It seems likely the utter failure of this film and Baywatch might put an end to all the 21 Jump St. clones out there. 

* **Ghost in the Shell (2017)** - The controversial anime film closed to a disappointing $40.5M domestic and $169.8M worldwide on a budget of $110M. The film received a lot of criticism for its whitewashing of the main character, even Paramount claiming that's why the film failed. However I think even more at heart is that frankly US audiences don't care about untested properties and that turning a heady anime that's not super well known by mass audiences into an action film just upsets both sides and no one wins. That said certainly GitS will join Exodus: Gods and Kings, Pan, and Gods of Egypt as notably whitewashed movies that were still colossal bombs despite having ""A list"" actors to give them international appeal.

They are spending WAY too much on these, holy shit.
  
Also, Covenant underperforming is a real shame, that universe could have been so cool if it had gone in another direction. Im a big fan of the first two, and I was going to see it, but.. I just can't get behind where they went with the story. I really liked Prometheus, my feelings are so conflicted on it. It's such a cool and in many ways great sci-fi movie, but they *fucked* up the Alien mythology. No other way to say it. They took the mysterious, creepy and fascinating Bone ship and Space Jockey, and took a huge steaming dump on it with this Engineer garbage. The idea is really cool, if it had been its own story. But setting it in the Alien universe to explain the xeno's, and the derelict etc was a *terrible* idea. The spooky mystery of this incredibly alien looking ship, with this cargo of eggs, piloted by a huge mummified creature, that has been there for thousands of years..

The biggest of my problems with this film is with Johnny Depp. In the first few movies you could see that behind Jack Sparrow's eccentric behaviour, lies a feeling human.

So when the sequel comes along with, let's just say, less then stellar reviews and a protagonist with the screen presence of a wet blanket, I'm sure as hell not going to open my wallet to see it in the cinema.

Which makes me think: why does Ridley Scott, and everybody else for that matter, seem to think he is in any way entitled or even qualified to develop the Alien mythos or whatever you wanna call it.

It gives casual audiences the impression that its quality is based on a hundred point scale when in reality it is a percentage of likes vs dislikes.  There is a vast gulf between like and dislike, however.  Movies that may generally be liked may not be loved, conversely movies that may be disliked may be hated.  For example, John Wick 2 was enjoyable but there were problems that reduced the score for me to an B/80, yet it scored on the Tomatometer similar to The Raid which is a classic.  

Tomatometer is a double edged sword, it's easier to score high - and low, and with casual audiences misperceiving its meaning, exacerbating the feast or famine results at the box office.  For example, I and others who watched King Arthur loved it but the Tomatometer score from reading through its threads scared people off.  I could see how divisive it could be but on balance and with a 1-10 rating system, should've at least been 40 percent (it's a 46 on RT's average critic score, 42 on Metacritic)

Movies are huge bets but RT scores are taking out the middle ground
 which will ultimately result in even fewer risky movies, midrange movies, and more franchises as Hollywood will seek to hedge bets with international ie big budget action.

The solution is already available on RT as it has the average critic scores.  It is this number that should be promoted to more accurately reflect a movie's quality, true gems and bombs will stand out, and the movies in the middle will be up to audiences to decide rather than an all too easy casual dismissal based on a misleading score.

It's funny you mention Sears.  They did fail to adequately adapt and recognize a changing market.   They were the largest retailer and got stuck with a vast amount of real estate that failed to generate revenue (shuttered Sears, Kmart retail stores).  Some of their holdings were converted into data centers.

The current trend for market segmentation will be an unmitigated disaster.  Consumers don't want to pay twenty businesses for 20 services.  Market segmentation offers choices, but often creates too many headaches.

Consumers want to pay one provider a reasonable fee with access to everything or have a choice to pay for what they want.  i.e. a la carte model.

Netflix's success is based on this consumer friendly model with reasonable rates and access to a diverse content library.

Hollywood has been trying to crack the China market for awhile now, but has had a difficult time due to protectionism in China.  The Chinese government has various restrictions on imports.

There are only so many foreign films each year permitted in China.  To get around that restriction, a film must be co-produced with a Chinese company, include Chinese actors, and have a certain amount of production in China.

That's why you see all these Hollywood blockbusters including plots or scenes in China.",breakr5

- Blomkamp is really, really good at VFX. This is just a fact. Even if you found everything after District 9 underwhelming (which I did, too), the technical elements of those films were very well done, especially the action scenes and integrating real actors with CGI components. Everyone seems to agree covenant's CGI was pretty bad in places, I think this is one area where he'd actually be better than Scott.

- Blomkamp's biggest problem has been that he writes his own scripts and he's not as good at that as he thinks he is. In this case, he would have been directing someone else's script so his shitty writing wouldn't have undermined his fantastic VFX work. 

- it would have been a direct continuation of the original films' plot and not a prequel that seems like it was written as an entirely separate franchise and then pasted the Aliens in later for brand recognition

Jack, Will, and Elizabeth SHARED the lead roles in the first trilogy. Don't get me wrong, Depp was undeniably the star, but in terms of screen time and character interactions, all three were the major players in those movies. They balanced each other out, with each character having their own arcs that ultimately carried the trilogy.

But having Jack as the sole lead in the last two films simply isn't as interesting. There's just too much of him now, and every supporting character (even Barbossa) is relegated to simply reacting off of Jack's quirkiness instead of challenging him like Will and Elizabeth constantly did. Everyone likes to rag on the romantic subplot of the first trilogy but it actually took up so little screen time. Shit, Will and Elizabeth spent a majority of the sequels on their own, trying to find each other. In At World's End they were even hostile to one another.

In other words Will and Elizabeth were a central part to what made the trilogy work so well. They just tend to get overlooked because of Depp's ability to steal his scenes and make it look like he was carrying the movies, when that simply wasn't the case at all.",thefablemuncher

But the script is terribly written and the film is horrendously paced and the ""King Arthur"" moments are pretty bad as far as I'm concerned.

The movie kind of reminded me of Suicide Squad, in that it starts out very stylized before losing most of that style later on. The only difference is, Suicide Squad loses it completely, while King Arthur has enough of it popping up occasionally to remind you that a better movie could have existed.

Frankly, I think it would have been better if it wasn't a King Arthur movie at all, or at least not about King Arthur himself. I kept thinking that if this was a movie about how street rats and hoodlums pounced on the opportunities King Arthur's revolution would create to establish themselves as quasi-allies of him while simultaneously becoming climbing ranks in the criminal underworld, we'd have a much more interesting movie.",HopelessCineromantic

Say there's a movie with where 5 critics rated it a 3/5, and 5 rated it a 4/5, which gives it a 50%. To finesse that score, they could:
- change what it means to be ""good"". If good means 3/5 instead of 4/5, suddenly the score is 100% again
- change what it means to be a critic. If they include a lot more critics than before, they can get the score boosted simply by adding to the pool. Maybe they approve bloggers or YouTube channels who tend to rate movies highly. In this example, adding 3 bloggers with 4/5 ratings turns the good/bad ratio into 8:5, which comes out to 61% - that's fresh!
- change the threshold for certifying a movie as fresh. If they decide 50% of critics is good enough, then suddenly this movie is 100% fresh again.
- change how they internally score reviews. Some critics use star ratings, some use thumbs up/down, some don't give a score at all but simply talk about the movie's successes and failures. There is a lot of room for interpretation there which could easily bump a movie a few percentage points.

They will probably do a combination of all these things. And I have no doubt they will. There have been studies showing that the ratings that Fandango shows in its app are almost always higher than the average of other sources.

Edit: I'm using these numbers just because they're good for the example, but they don't accurately represent how the actual tomatometer works. I believe the general concepts are accurate though.

tl;dr - you can change the variables for an RT score to improve it",nearcatch

The movie is also not really about bay watch. It's a police comedy that happens to be set on the beach. Bay watch was always about lifeguards, not about lifeguards who thought they were cops. 

And as someone else said, the tv show was unintentionally funny. It wasn't a comedy but rather a ""so bad it's funny"" type show that was self aware. The movie tries to be a straight up comedy. 

I'd also say that the BT show had a very strong moral compass and had heart. It was always a little too wholesome.

It was a dramatic-action type show that took itself a little too seriously and wound up unintentionally campy, Hasselhoff's signature move, though I think they were more self-aware and played along with it in later seasons.

That campiness, combined with it's inoffensiveness and clicheed happy-endings-with-heart, gave it a sort of charm that made it an acceptable guilty pleasure. Nobody considered it ground-breaking television, but you weren't necessarily ridiculed for openly admitting to watch it, either.

To me it looks like Covenant should be able to roughly break even at worst with its theatrical run, and make it's way to an OK-at-best profit from blu ray sales, merchandise, and what not. It also looks like if they do make another one, getting a big budget is probably not on the table; depending on how the Scott/studio balance of power went in production, they might decide to exert more or less influence as well. And making a sequel at all might just be off the table entirely.

Interestingly, the series has never been a big box office record breaker. Alien and Aliens were very financially successful, but only because they had low production budgets; they brought in about $100m and $130m, respectively. That's very successful for when they came out, but the franchise hasn't really zoomed much past that in the years since. Alien 3 and Resurrection brought in about $160m each, and Prometheus was the most successful by far, at about $400m.

I'd lean towards lowering the budgets to account for the apparent core audience size in order to maintain profitability.",Geistbar

I think the Fast & Furious movies are terrible, but undeniably the thing fans keep coming back for is seeing their favorite characters getting into a story they can follow that puts the characters in fun scenes. That's a pretty starkly different type of characterization from, say, Moonlight. Complex doesn't mean better to a huge portion of the population. The Big Bang Theory pulls way higher numbers than Breaking Bad ever did. But the characters and the story are what people love about both those shows, or the Fast movies, as different as they are. I think they should try to make the next Fast movie for $150M and see if anyone notices. I bet it still does gangbusters as long as the framework is there. ",SetYourGoals

Ask anyone who actually works in the business, the ""Hollywood Accounting"" thing is a myth from a bygone era. 

Talent participation deals used to be based on net earnings vs. gross earnings. So some shady companies would try to shield profits from participation deals. But that's long since gone away, agents don't make those deals anymore. Even the most publicized instance of this, Forrest Gump, ended up being a total falsehood, admitted by the author who made the allegation. But only the ""Forrest Gump made no profit!??!?!"" headline sticks in people's heads. 

That's just not how it works. The budgets are out of control. The ideas are bad. It's going to hit critical mass eventually. The tentpole floor is going to fall out. But it's got nothing to do with weird accounting. Just stupid old people running the studios. ",SetYourGoals

It's important to realize they have all been down on their luck and destitute for YEARS prior to the start of the film. Jack has not found a way to free the Pearl, Barbossa rules the sea, immortality has eluded him and he can't even pull off a heist anymore as his plans fail. He's in a bad dark place and is an actual alcoholic at the start of the film. Gibbs is literally starving. The whole movie is about him finding himself and a purpose again.

-That case is Stan Lee suing Marvel **Comics** about a bunch of different properties. It includes Fox movies, Sony movies, Universal movies, etc. Marvel eventually [settled with him,](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/29/business/media/marvel-settles-with-a-spiderman-creator.html), but it's certainly not ""Hollywood accounting."" It's Marvel not paying Lee, not a movie studio.

-New Line was a shitty production company, not a studio, and they settled with Jackson. 

-The Stallone thing we need to hear the WB side of, we've only heard Stallone's complaint, but again, that's one of those 3 decade old deals that they don't make anymore, and seems more like WB Home Ent just fucking up in 1997 and then trying to cover their asses when someone asked about it 20 years later. 

Other big instances that get brought up a lot:

- My Big Fat Greek Wedding - Production company, not studio. And the plaintiffs [dropped that case, with no settlement, and were apparently paid $44M in profit participation as their contract dictated.](http://www.eonline.com/news/20525/hanks-drops-suit-against-greek-wedding-parties)

- Winston Groom + Forrest Gump - ""I wasn't suing Paramount,"" Groom said. ""I had a question about the royalty statement, which I didn't understand. When I spoke to Paramount I was assured everything was OK. I'm delighted with this agreement."" [Source.](http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Gump-Author-Settles-Fight-With-Studio-3031365.php) This quote is a month after that story blew up, and it's still the #1 most cited incidence of ""hollywood accounting."" Even though it's bullshit, the man was paid, and the bigger profit participants were on gross deals, not net. Also that was decades ago.

I've seen some funky things with moving money around from x department to y department, especially with P&A money, depending on where it's advantageous to show profit or loss for the company. But that's not ""hollywood accounting."" Hollywood Accounting is hiding profits in order to fuck people who made participation deals. They don't do that anymore, and I'm not convinced it was widespread 30 years ago. With the rise of CAA and talent power, those deals just don't happen, and the studios would be caught, in court, and no talent would work with them.

That's not how it works? Nobody just wakes and decides not to pay someone. They all sign contracts beforehand. The predatory structuring of the contracts to deny money based on profitability is what I would consider Hollywood accounting. It being a studio or production company isn't really relevant, especially when most movies have production companies created just for the accounting books.

> But people who know nothing about the industry or who are super bitter that they aren't in it

No that's just not what it is. Commonly the term is used only to describe the practice of saying a profitable movie has not made a profit, so that you do not have to pay out profit participation on deals that only kick in at certain profit levels. It's a very specific thing, and it's pretty rare for a production company to be in the position to even commit this. The kinds of talent deals we are talking about are made by the studios the vast majority of the time. The examples you specifically cited were a comic book company sort of doing it and a 30 year old deal pertaining to downstream revenue that we have no idea about the validity of. If this was happening we'd have tons of examples, there would be lawsuits left and right. Don't take my word for it, ask anyone in the industry, especially at a major agency. They wouldn't structure talent deals in a way that even allows this to be a possibility. Maybe they used to, but the talent has power now. 

New Line wasn't a production company created for accounting a movie though. It was one of the largest and most insular production companies, and they were in a particular position of control on LOTR as they had the rights, funded it, etc, not a traditional studio like WB. New Line was a part of Time Warner, but it was still very independent. If I had to guess, Michael Lynne who was COO at New Line, might have unilaterally made the call not to pay out the participations, especially to Jackson. They didn't like Jackson, I think they were mad that he got all the credit, and they were still seen as outsiders by Hollywood. That's what it looks like at least. There's a really good Vanity Fair piece on them from a long time ago that is worth a read, the company has a weird and interesting story. 

And sorry I wasn't saying YOU are super bitter or not in the industry or whatever, sorry if it came off that way, I was typing that quickly running around on my phone. I'm just saying that there's an odd amount of vitriol that comes from people when they are told the ""hollywood accounting"" thing is essentially a trumped up myth. You're smart and having a discussion and clearly open to learning, finding sources, etc. I'm concurrently dealing with a guy who challenging the fact that I even work in the industry, calling me names, etc. Over some ""here's how the business works"" comment I made. It's happened before a couple times too. I've spoken with other people in the industry who post here, and they said they've had the same arguments with angry people over the Hollywood accounting thing. So, my only idea on why they are so angry is that they are bitter about the industry in general, for whatever personal reasons, and they always saw this as a great thing to point to about Hollywood. It's truly odd how resistant people are to this specific idea (and also finding out how the box office returns and film profitability actually works, same reaction a lot of the time). 

I've yet to see a compelling argument that this happens, it wasn't happening at two of the three major studios I've worked at (I couldn't look at accounting info at the third). Accounting firms would meticulously audit us pretty frequently, even the small budgets that I handled. I'm sure some weird shit goes on with the money. Taxes and interest and department shifting. But to think the studios are royally screwing over the major talent on giant tentpole movies (which is where I usually see this brought up) is just not possible. It would be front page news on Deadline every day. ",SetYourGoals

I've pretty meticulously sifted through the budgets of giant movies at two major studios. I was personally responsible for the accounting on smaller roughly $10M budgets at these studios, but that gave me access to see all the numbers. This stuff interests me so, I looked at as much as I could. 

So the director of Emily Rose says he didn't get any money from a 5% net deal. Assuming he's correct, which he very well may not have been, there are some obstacles to profitability there. Usually those deals are tiered, to start with, so maybe they don't kick in until after X amount of box office or X amount of profit. So say it's 5% of everything after $20M in profit or something. So they don't have big participation, but if it's some Exorcist or Paranormal Activity runaway hit, they get a good piece. That would be pretty standard for a first time director I'd guess, which he was. Then look at the actual box office. The movie probably brought in roughly $37M domestic, and $24M international or so, give or take, so let's call it a $60M return. The production budget was listed at $19M. This had a pretty heft marketing spend I would think, several times the cost of the budget. I looked on Wikileaks, but this movie was too old to have good theatrical profit data on there or the total marketing budget. I did find the marketing budget for Taiwan, which you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/BtbgVsl.png) or get from Wikileaks with an easy search. $4M in Taiwan alone for marketing, where it made $1,170,319 at the box office. I'd conservatively guess the marketing budget/releasing costs for the US were $35-40M, and maybe the same for the rest of the world combined, hard to know. It could be a lot higher but I'm being conservative for the sake of argument here. 

Now we're looking at a lot more than $60M in costs. So...yes, it's very possible that they did not turn a theatrical profit on the movie, in fact it seems likely that they didn't. I'm sure they hit profitability with TV and this was the heyday of DVD, but I'm not sure a first time director would have any downstream participation. 

Sounds like a case where the guy just had a bad deal, and the movie didn't make any money in theaters, and they spent way too much on marketing back then. 

The Harry Potter thing is just internal weird bookkeeping for WB. They paid themselves a distribution fee, moved money, etc. But if they were fucking people over with this, as people like to imply, the second this document hit deadline they'd be up to their eyes in lawsuits from the cast and producers. Who gives a shit what their internal system is? Also, looking at that doc, this looks like it's just a distribution sheet. Where is the production budget? That was reportedly $150M. And they they spent $131M just on the ad buys. $60M more in other smaller marketing and fee costs. And they got $460M in box office returns, based on this document. I'll admit I don't get a ton about distribution costs, they've always been very separate from anything I've done, but it isn't exactly insane that there weren't overwhelming profits from a movie they spent $350M to make and got $460M in box office. They made $100M, they moved money, minimized taxes, etc. That's corporations. Why do you or anyone have a problem with this unless it's screwing over the talent? You have a problem with the entire idea of corporate accounting? Hollywood Accounting means a pretty specific thing. Shielding the studio from having to pay net participation deals by erroneously showing no profits. 

I agree corporate accounting is batshit crazy, I don't think companies like the studios, or Apple or any other huge company, should get to avoid taxes with loopholes. But that's not what people are talking about when they scream ""Hollywood Accounting!"" The common definition just isn't something that's going on in the modern entertainment industry. ",SetYourGoals

Funny was just watching this one recently. They really shot a lot of that film practically, where today big budget action/adventure films like Marvel movies are criticized for over use of green screen/CGI, DMC really went out to those islands, those sword fights are really on a tiny stretch of sand bar & in the jungle.

I think one of the biggest problems (that each Pirates movie built on) is the development of the three main characters. In Curse, Jack is not the main protagonist. He’s the sidekick foil to Will. And yes, he does have some goofy moments, but in Curse he’s much more of a clever, conniving character. Each movie subsequently made him dumber, goofier, and more clearly “the main character”. Will is the traditional hero of Curse, going through a hero arc and realizing that pirates aren’t all bad. He’s stubborn and naive, but also caring and brave. The sequels mostly just have him around for action and the “save Dad vs marry Elizabeth” choice. Elizabeth gets more of an arc in the sequels, but they don’t build much on her initial character. She remains stubborn, headstrong, and adventurous, while getting into more and more crazy situations. Honestly, Norrington and Davy Jones have the best character development in the sequels. 

TLDR: I still really like DMC and AWE, but I think a big reason people like CotBP so much is the characters.",cooperthetrooper

They turn Jack into a fucking brain dead moron. He was never stupid, he was often the smartest person in the room, he just played a fool to get peoples guards down. By the fifth one it was just dumb luck saving his life, it sucked ass.

And then Elizabeth goes from being Pirate King back to being some kind of prim and proper rich person? That dress she is wearing at the very end of the last movie is ridiculous. The whole ""trident breaks all curses"" shit was also fucking stupid, because they teased Davy Jones and I am so happy the series got cancelled and they couldn't bring him back to ruin his story.

wbw8vq,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a sequel in a different league than the rest of the POTC sequels.,iicmxpw,2022-07-31 05:51:52,"In my opinion, when someone says they don't like 2/3, I think it's because the plot is more complex than the first one, and they either didn't like, or weren't quite tracking the different and competing motivations for the many characters.

Pirates 1 motivations are pretty straight forward:

* Jack: Wants the Black Pearl and generally money
* Will: Wants to save Elizabeth
* Norington: Wants to save Elizabeth and marry her
* Barbossa & Crew: Wants the curse lifted

Pirates 2 and 3 motivations get a lot more complex and alliances shift over the course of the films:

* Jack: Wants to get out of his deal with Davy Jones and never die
* Will: Wants to get his dad back from Davy Jones
* Elizabeth: Wants a pardon so they can live happily ever after
* Davy Jones: Just doing his job and pissed at Calypso
* Norington: Wants to get his station back and regain honor
* Gibbs & Crew: Wants to survive and make $
* Bootstrap Bill: Wants to save his son
* Capt Feng: Wants to release Calypso
* Tia Dalma: Wants to be released I guess
* Cutler Beckett: Wants to rule the seas by controlling Davy Jones

CGI is a tool and Verbinski is a master. He knows when a scene needs it and how it blends with practical FX. Davy Jones looks astounding because he knew how to shoot him and how to set him up. The movie truly looks like a 200 million dollar movie should look like. Every shot looks expensive an immersive. There is CGI in the movie but it looks impressive. Davy Jones looks real. Even in 4K the effect holds up. Marvel directors have no idea how to make a scene work with VFX or how to shoot something outside without green screen.

With Davy Jones, they somehow [transformed an actor into this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YrEsKmwcp3I/maxresdefault.jpg).

He has a bunch of mannerisms and movements through the films too, and Bill Nighy did an excellent job with his portrayal! They made him come to life [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp1rS_UAvjs) and you can just see how he exudes the feeling of the man sailors fear on a ship. He'd been alluded to in pirate lore and up until this part of the film we haven't seen him.

Bootstrap Bill gave a frightening tale to Jack that this man has the *Kraken* working for him, of all things. If the Reaper of the seas is coming to collect your soul, he'll be intimidating for sure. It's a lot of work to get a CGI character right, and in 2006 they did a phenomenal job. Thinking about it now, just two years later we got the first Iron Man, and I still love the CGI in that movie. I know with how complicated the MCU is now, they basically made Iron Man's last suit iterations nanotech and much more ""fluid"" so that the CGI would probably be simpler, but I really love going back and seeing how much effort went into the first suit (I'm pretty sure they made an actual model of his suit), and the weight felt pretty believable.

Agreed. 1 is classic, 2 is epic. The scale jumps. The production quality is much better. Now Jack, Will & Liz are small beings in a much bigger, dangerous world with the likes of Lord Beckett and Davy Jones around. It added a danger and edge to the world. The ships look and feel magnificent.

Then those 2, Norrington & Jack go on a hunt for Davy's chest to gain control of it for their own reasons. jack wants to call the kraken off, Will wants to free his father and Norrinton wants to send it to Beckett to gain his status back in the Navy. Elizabeth gets to find her true self more as she is more at ease on ships than in corsets. She is an adventure girl after all. There isn't much overstuffed or technical about this. Part 3 is where that starts.

5 absolutely. 5 is a disgrace to the franchise. Funnily, I think 4 respeced the characters. Jack, Hector and Gibbs were the same as before. It's just that the story for 4 was boring and without the Pearl and most of the earlier crew, it felt a bit empty.

*At World's End* is clearly a conclusion. Just like *Return of the Jedi* is a conclusion, or like how *Matrix Revolutions* is a conclusion. You shouldn't have yet another sequel after the conclusion.

Some movies aren't resolutions in the usual sense, but are a kind of good farewell to the characters, like *Toy Story 3* or *The Last Crusade*, and yet they too get further sequels.

In the first film, all of those characters' subplots all tied into the central plot. While they do in the sequel, as well, that central plot is more a MacGuffin than a story. It's a bunch of independent threads coming together because of the chest, but so much of those threads requires a ton of exposition which makes the film feel overstuffed. The first film was *The Black Pearl* crew's motivation against the motivations of the other parties to save Elizabeth (Will and Norrington) or save their ship (Jack and the other pirates) - since those opposing Barbosa all have a goal that lends to each other, it flows so much more naturally. 

In *Dead Man's Chest*, it's ""I wanna free my Daddy,"" ""I wanna save my fiancé (even though I'm doubting I want to),"" ""I'm not sure what I want, but I wanna not be killed by the Kraken,"" ""I don't want these fuckers to stab my heart,"" and ""I'm not sure what I want, but, hey, everyone else wants this thing, so I must want it too."" No one really shares any motivations, so it's a juggle. This movie starts the clusterfuck of backstabbing that makes the cup flow over in the third film. It's all engineered drama, where the first excelled at the characters' all sharing a motivation while having different goals - the sequel is different goals *and* different motivations, but driven to claim the same solution. It just doesn't land as well.",axlkomix

To me, Pirates 4 felt like a continuation that was at least hinted at after At World's End. I know it's hard for the movie to feel as much like a Pirates movie because the trilogy was wrapped up nicely and ended some important character arcs. It's a good thing they didn't bring them back (looking at you 5), but at the same time I can't deny I'm biased with 4 because I'm a fan of Barbossa.

I know everyone loves Jack Sparrow but I personally loved Hector Barbossa more as a character. He just feels like the most pirate-y pirate out of them all, and in a way Pirates 4 is basically seeing Barbossa go through the same arc Jack did in the first Pirates movie. We don't see him reduced to something weak, instead we see Barbossa conquering his newfound weakness and going for revenge against a notoriously feared pirate.

Shown in IMAX, and everything was fine through the ads and the IMAX intro bit, but when the film itself started, it kept on flickering in and out. About 5 minutes in, the staff fixed and restarted it.

After the film, I overheard staff talking about it, and it was something to do with the film *not* being actual IMAX format, yet the ads were.

What made it all the more hilarious is at the start, there was a card noting that the film isn’t true IMAX, but at the end, there was an ad about the “true IMAX experience” or something to that effect. The audience just laughed at how ridiculous it was.

Similarly, when I saw the *Witch Watch: Watch Party* theatrical preview a week later, at the same cinema. The screen initially cut off half of the subtitles, making them harder to read. About 10 minutes later, the screen zoomed out - presumably because the projectionist assumed it would have a theatrical aspect ratio and not one used for television. I hope that projectionist learned the importance of having a test run…",Joshawott27

1jvsj8d,What movie did you watch in theater which experienced technical problems?,mmh3g86,2025-04-10 23:15:33,"Many movies I can remember where I had some technical issues.



Lilo & Stitch (2002): Fire alarm went off (can’t remember during what scene) and I believe the movie resumed. Was my first technical issue during any movie at any movie theater.

King Kong (2005): Not sure if the fire alarm went off, but I think there was heavy rain during that time that caused the projector to stop for a bit. Came back on before Kong’s battle with the planes and his death that was killed by Beauty.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Fire alarm also went off in a scene during a fight between the main character’s father and his unruly neighbor before Caesar was subsequently taken to the ape shelter. As we were evacuating, one of the moviegoers thought it was part of the movie when Caesar attacked that idiotic neighbor, which was crazy. Resumed exactly where it left off where he then injured him (getting what he deserved) after defending the prior.

Alvin and the Chipmunks 3: Aspect ratio inadvertently swapped to 2.39:1 throughout the film.

Home Alone (2015 re-release): Thankfully no fire alarm this time. The special engagement movie event wouldn’t start the movie at all after the pre-show due to projection issues, so we got free passes. Would’ve loved to experience it in the theater on that 25th anniversary of the first one since I wasn’t born when it came out.

Early Man: Only the policy trailer occurred after the glitch screen, going straight to the previews. No pre-show content (as well as no commercials) beforehand. Like Alvin 3, the aspect ratio was accidentally swapped to 2.39:1 throughout the film also (when I know they’re actually 1.85:1), covering the top and bottom, which was probably the result of a glitch from earlier. Very distracting!

Toy Story 4: It went to black (along with no audio during that technical issue) for a minute during Gabby Gabby’s emotional departure from the gang, which disrupted the saddest moment. Resumed but rewound about a minute or two.

Jurassic World Dominion: Pre-show started, but no previews afterwards. Had to wait about 10-15 minutes for it to start. Movie finally started, except it started about 30-40 seconds into this movie from the opening logos.

Champions: No pre-show (unlike Jurassic World 3) and no previews. Went straight to the film.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie: Same as Jurassic World 3, except only the policy trailer and feature presentation trailer occurred after the pre-show, going straight to the movie also.",Occupied_Octopi

Thankfully they turned on the lights and turned off the animatronics and music and everything so we didn’t loose our minds. Then we eventually got pushed to an escape and got to walk through the inside of the ride and then they let us get anything we wanted from the gift shop and I got the biggest fucking sombrero I had ever seen.

We went to Disney with my family and this girl I liked but we went on the ride ourselves. We didn’t have cell phones and my family genuinely thought we died. Which was why we were allowed whatever from the gift shop. Never found out what happened.

Hot summer day, movie theater at Fort Ord near Monterey was packed with people trying to escape the heat.

Unfortunately the projector wasn't working right. It was an ancient carbon arc type from the 1930's era. The sound was garbled. 

I had a technical services company in San Luis Obispo, and got a call from the theater asking if I worked on projectors. He got my number from a paper phone book (remember those?). Well, no I don't, I said, but I'm sure I can fix it. I jumped in my truck and raced up there. About a 2 hour drive. 

The problem turned out to be simple and easily fixed, and he fired up the projector and started the movie. The whole place erupted in applause and cheers. They'd probably been sitting in there for nearly three hours waiting.

The best part was I hung out in the projection booth and watched the movie with him... I've always wanted to do that! Unfortunately I can't remember what movie it was, but I think it was a Bond film.",rdcpro

The first one was indeed amazing, I am a supporter of the next two because I enjoy the overarching story. But beyond those 3 the franchise does go through a fundamental shift centering around my next point. The main characters of the film changes to Jack Sparrow. That’s my next personal opinion, Jack Sparrow was part of the main characters but not the focus. In fact the story of the first three movies center almost completely on Will Turner and Elizabeth and Jack is an elevated side character for the most part.

I do think the whole franchise has been unfairly looked down on. While I understand the burn out after the first 4 (and now we’re getting a boringly competent version of Jungle Cruise as a response to the success of PotC), I think history will be more kind to the original trilogy of films.",Skele11
