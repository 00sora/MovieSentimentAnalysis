This is the nickname I give to Zack Snyder's consistent use of dream sequences. 


300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, and Sucker Punch (pretty much most of the last one in particular) involve a dream sequence of some sort. It makes it REALLY easy for Snyder to fit in whatever visuals he wants, but at times this can feel out of place for the movie.

I went into BvS expecting at least one dream sequence, but I ended up counting FOUR. Spoilers ahead:


1- Bruce as a child falling into a well finding the Batcave. He then levitates with the bats circling and becomes some sort of Bat Jesus??? This scene was a great mirror to a very similar scene in the Nolan trilogy, except this one had Snyder's twist. I didn't mind this too much, and it definitely set the tone for Snyder's take on Batman.


2- Bruce's nightmare of Superman attacking him in the warzone. This one wasn't too ridiculous, but the flying bugs seemed a bit out of place and confused me as the viewer (I know this sets up for a future film). I felt like this was pretty long, but it at least had action. I felt like Snyder had a great idea for this scene before getting a script and sort of forced it into the script this way.This is a pretty good scene on its own, but it did feel very forced into the movie due to its length and allusion to future conflicts that I had no idea about when watching.


3- Bruce sees a Bat monster in the Wayne Crypt. I didn't mind this, but also couldn't help but think back to the appearance of Batman according to Scarecrow under the effects of the hallucinogenic in Batman Begins. This wasn't bad, and it did serve a neat purpose. It also wasn't too long and pretty atmospheric. I did enjoy this sequence and would have kept it in.


4- Clark seeing his father in a dream, I walked out of the movie to pee at this part since I was tired of these sequences. I felt little to no connection to his father due to how he was written in Man of Steel and really didn't feel connected enough to him at this point. I did miss part of it, so maybe the scene was needed? I get that a scene like this would want to show Superman's struggle, but I would rather it be with his mother or another character of sorts. Like Jor-el in MOS, just because a character is dead in this universe doesn't mean they won't have any less screen time.




It still just felt like there was too much Snyderism in an already overstuffed movie. I am not saying that dream sequences are bad (sometimes they are needed) I am just saying that they felt forced just for the pretty visual effects more often than not in the film

On another note, I really mostly know DC characters from DC animated series and movies. Superman in the movie is not like the JL/JLU Superman at all. Is the new 52 Superman more like the movie Superman? In the first JLU episode, Superman is the one who talks to all the new recruits and is portrayed as THE leader.

I really wonder what Warners/DC do now. Do they hold the line, and follow through with everything they have in the works? Suicide Squad looks strong, and Wonder Woman was the only thing to escape the wreckage of BvS unharmed, so between those films they could do a successful regain by next year. But they have to be looking very closely at Snyder and what he's delivering. 

Ironically, I think the one thing that would really sink their efforts is tighter studio control and more tinkering/meddling with what they're doing. Aside from a few of the more egregiously misjudged character moments, (Supe's hyper-murdering a dude, Lex's logic free plan, MARTHA,) and some action sequences that were just tension-free sets of noisey explosions, the biggest problem the film really had was stuffing in all the references and world building. Take all that put, and you might have had a better paced film, which would have really helped it. 

OTOH, I can't see them pulling him off JL any time soon, he's probably got more knowledge and experience with what they're doing than anyone, and he's been in the WB pocket since 300. He's giving them what they want, but they are out of touch with what the audience wants. 

I'm most curious now as to whether Affleck is going to want to keep on this, and make a Batman film, given how badly this has gone for him. He wasn't interested at first, and they gave him a lot of concessions and control to get him onboard, and it's still turned to shit for him. People may have liked his Batman, but this is still a project where 'his guy' got a writing credit, and he got as much creative control as a star can expect. That's going to stick to him.

A lot of hate I heard about the film centered on Superman being ""changed"" because he wasn't trying to keep the fight away from Metropolis and because he kills Zod. In the context of the film, it made sense because he was put between a rock and a hard place and he was also very inexperienced fighting against experienced Kryptonian soldiers.

I did the same approach with BvS and really appreciated how different and thought provoking the movie was. Fun aside, no MCU film has ever left me pondering about it after the movie ended. Hell, in the MCU one of the characters is Thor, literally a god from the Norse mythology, and MCU never touches on how his appearance changed the world. Because it's not supposed to, they're fun, light, Disney films for everyone.

DCCU are treating Batman Superman and Wonder Woman with plenty of respect, yet not being afraid to challenge them and make them do things fans were not expecting. The film doesn't deserve the negative media bias it is receiving. For me, it was refreshing to have a superhero movie that isn't full of quips and Buffy the Vampire slayer dialogue. All the backlash aside, I truly hope Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman do well in bringing some people into the DCCU without giving in to the cookie-cutter and made-by-committee feel that the MCU currently has.",None

Still, Warner Brothers knows the potential earnings of the film and when BvS doesn't make it, they will ensure the next films aren't bad. They have to build a multi-movie franchise on this.

It may not sound important but I had a hard time understanding some phrases we didn't use in Argentina. Disney's movies use a fairly neutral Spanish and the actors are just as good as the originals because they specialize in this line of work so they're no amateurs.

Yes not every shortcoming falls solely on the director, but given the trajectory he's had lately he likely shouldn't have even directed BvS. I remember not entirely enjoying Man of Steel, but at least that movie was wholly Superman. A decent origin story and a masterpiece in retrospect compared to BvS.

I agree that studio pressure likely prompted the bloated nature of BvS, but an adept story teller could have weaved the threads more coherently and in interviews you can tell, as people have said, he clearly communicates that he doesn't understand these characters. 

It would have to be a proven director for sure, one that's hard to think of at the moment, but the only people upset will be the die hard fans that saw no wrong in BvS despite its countless missteps. When this fails to make much more than $900 million and the brutal critical and audience reactions continues to simmer, DC going forward and allowing Snyder to helm essentially the defining film in their universe after making arguably the worst superhero movie ever made would be crazy of them.

300 and Watchmen turned out (arguably) well because he had amazing source material. Clearly when it's an original project he can't bring it together and BvS is the culmination of all of his directorial shortcomings showcased in what should have been a sure thing. Looking at what Whedon did with the Avengers, twice the characters and complexity, and how badly Snyder was able to bungle established characters from DC...it's all pretty shocking.",artmaximum99

For comparion, here are the Cinemascores of several comic book films:

>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - B+ 

>The Avengers - A+ 

>Avengers: Age of Ultron - A 

>Batman Begins - A

>**Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - B** 

>Catwoman - B 

>Daredevil - B 

>Elektra - B 

>Fantastic Four - B 

>FF: Rise of the Silver Surfer - B 

Furthermore a low Cinemascore is practically a guarantee that this will drop quite a bit at the Box Office week to week, especially for films based on comic books. This is looking pretty bleak for WB.

*“Every time one of these guys punches someone through a building, our margins go up 3%. We should be celebrating.”*

And thanks to Agents of SHIELD, we're explained how asgardian mythology came to Earth. There's a whole episode that shows how an asgardian that had been on Earth for thousands of years ended up making all the mythology up.

Sorry, but they don't care about any review, reviewer, or review aggregating site. It's just the way it is. They care about $. In this case, word of mouth could have generated sustainable numbers in terms of repeat viewings, DVD/BluRay sales, etc. and in that regard the reviews will be cited if the film underperforms. But, if the film smashed every record ever and makes over a billion they won't even care to look (for proof see: Transformers the franchise).

To be fair, if it were 0% on rotten tomatoes but it made over a billion they would be thrilled. RT does nothing for the studio execs, literally nothing, at least directly. Now, indirectly, it absolutely had an effect because a friend of mine who is normally, ""dude we have to see this BIG RELEASE this week!"" instead said, ""dude, BvS is getting savaged in reviews!""

But if Snyder doesn't 'get' the characters, does anyone at Warners? 

If they were to replace him now, that would be a giant signal of no-confidence in what they are doing. If they bring in someone else, that person is going to have to essentially fulfil the blueprint for JL that Snyder has laid down. Or, they're going to have to push everything 1-2 years. That would likely turn BvS's underperformance into an actual financial loss, as they lose money and time on what they already have, and suddenly star commitments look shakey. They're already near complete on SS, and WW is already filming. This train is moving, and it cannot stop now, not for at least another three years and 3-5 more films. They have to leave Snyder in charge, because the only thing worse would be ejecting him and getting in *another* hack to try and realize his vision, (however much you may snort at that phrase). 

Nobody of any quality is going to line up for that job - don't even think Affleck is prepared to take it all on! - so they have no choice. Snyder will deliver JL, 1&2, and if he doesn't nail it out the park, he'll be done for a good long while. Meanwhile, Warners have to tack all their hopes on 'the bad guys' (I love the meta narratives in the movie business!) and see if David Ayer can't get the ship back on course.

They start filming in less than a week which means they've already payed off for buildings, crew, resources, actors, etc. Taking Snyder off would mean delaying and having to find another director to fill his shoes and basically burning loads of money they already invested. It would also make news and really hurt their stock if they did that and could make investors very angry.  
So they have to weigh the choice between firing Snyder, delaying what they've been planning for a while and throwing away a ton of money and stock or they keep everything going and maybe give Snyder a codirector and hope that JL doesn't destroy their brand any harder and at least makes profit. They've really dug themselves into a hole by not only putting so much faith and control into Zack Snyder's hands but by letting him get to JL so fast after BvS came out.",SEND_HAPPY_SELFIES

Now we had Deadpool who was a massive hit (considering expectations, it's not on BvS, Civil War probable levels but was not meant to) but it did so by being very different from other superhero movies.

Box office returns have nothing to do with quality. But we're talking business here. If you're betting your company's future on a major blockbuster to create a thousand other major blockbusters, you want to make as much money as possible. You don't want to alienate anybody, which is what DC did by gambling on Zack Snyder's vision again. They want billions, they're not going to get it, it's just bad business.",BlueHighwindz

Doubt they (or their parents) had much fun through that 2.5 hour 2edgy4u slog. People will buy tickets to opening day no matter what, but sales go down over time in response (partially) to reviews and word of mouth. Fact is, if much of the general public expects something they can take more of their family to, making a movie that fails to deliver in that regard is going to cost you in the long run. Who was this movie even for? My 60-year-old parents liked Star Wars: TFA and went to see it of their own accord, but they certainly weren't about to go see this. To make a blockbuster with staying power you have to appeal beyond normal demographics, which is something Marvel is very good at doing. DC thinks they can coast on teenage boys and men 18-30, but the biggest hits have to transcend that.",None

The only time they rushed and took a risk was putting out the first Captain America and Thor in the same summer, and even that worked since they both nailed the core of what made those characters interesting and distinct.

but even if god himself came down from heaven with a rusty machete to my balls and said ""dont go to see BvS because it sucks yo"", i would have seen it regardless, why? im almost a 30 year old guy, yet, all my life i wanted to see these DC heroes interacting on the big screen, , so, is the movie flawed? it fucking is,  the downsides are known: bad editing, and some bad pacing on the first hour, 30 minutes of scenes were cut on the theatrical version, yet some bad scenes stayed(and its not that they are bad scenes by themselves, its just that didnt fit the narrative of the movie), also the crammed in Justice League tie-ins, that would have fitted in after credits much better..


yet all of those negatives didnt drag me down, and i enjoyed the GOOD in this movie tremendously, the things that are well done, are truly well done, there are parts that to me are worth the price of the tickets alone (ive been there 2 times, today ill go a third), and i just couldnt miss all that, besides i avoided every trailer and spoiler, so i was in a blank state,  and the majority of people already saw the movie in the trailer (the trailer is THAT revealing holy shit).

What is helpful is moments that are fun or at least upbeat.  The Dark Knight is a rather dark movie, but at its core it's about Batman not succumbing to his darkest desires even under the worst of strains.  He will not kill, even after what the Joker did, and even if the Joker seems wholly incapable of redemption.  That's in stark contrast to BvS where Batman kills people without remorse or even any real acknowledgment.

Plus as cheesy as it was, the Joker is ultimately foiled by the inherent good in people.  Batman in BvS says that people are good, but his speech is hallow in the context of that movie whereas in The Dark Knight, they actually show you the goodness of people even in a city that dark and gritty.  That's uplifting and that's the kind of thing that BvS lacked.

You might have never read a comic book to laugh, but comic books aren't afraid to be fun and sometimes more than a little silly.  Not to say DC needs to be more like Marvel, but the Marvel movies haven't been afraid of embracing those aspects of comic books while still having their big action moments and scenes of drama and I think that's to their credit.

I can't say that either Avengers movie had a great plot when you get down to it, but at very least they were willing to have fun.",Sanhen

It's why we have so many alternate versions of him. It's why characters are given depth by showing how they're not him.

Superman is generally given depth by exploring the idea of how someone who wants to do good and *can* do good still can't fix the world.

These themes were also explored in BvS. He wonders if he's right for this world. He wonders if he *should* help, when he has nothing to fear. He wonders if his presence is more trouble to the psychology of mankind than his powers are helpful. He also learns to trust someone else to actually help. He learns that it didn't have to be him. He learns that he's not invincible.

All of those things add to his character's depth. People look to kryptonite as being the lazy flaw added to tone down his perfection. However, if you look at what's actually been done with his character over the years, kryptonite isn't his biggest problem. Living in his own mind is.",arcosapphire

That's the thing. Of all those characters, the only ones I knew of before in any context was Captain America, in more of the running joke/outdated character context, and the Hulk, because well, he's the Hulk. I knew next to nothing about the characters going in. I learned a lot of their basic history in their two hour movies which were (usually) well written, which inspired me to learn more about each, and become a fan. Now when these new films come out, I'm excited and anxious for what's going to happen, because I've gone from having no emotional investment in these characters to some, because the movies took the time to give me a reason to care. I mean, for fuck's sake, a group of heroes that no one except hardcore fans knew about that include a *talking* raccoon managed to gross 3/4 of a billion dollars, through good word of mouth, a semi-coherent story and some fantastic actor choices.

*Batman v Superman* doesn't do that, maybe because it feels it doesn't have to (and to give them credit, Batman and Superman are so iconic that rehashing their origins again is just redundant(and Snyder does it anyway because reasons)). It throws me in, expecting I should know who these characters are, and that they suddenly expect I should care. Why? What emotional investment am I supposed to put in these characters? Why should I care? In *The Avengers* I care because I have spent five movies watching these characters coming to terms with being heroes, and wanting them to succeed against a greater threat. *Batman v Superman* is asking me to do the same thing in 120 mins, with informed character growth, and I'm sorry, but that near impossible to pull off.

It will have to be something as big as replacing Zack Snyder. He would have been a good one off director for one of the lesser known DC characters. He's not the kind of powerhouse director that could helm such a gigantic ship as the DCCU. None of his previous works suggests he's up to that task. I think he would have been much better going all out with his unique style on Lobo or someone fun and insane like that.

Just like Guardians of the Galaxy were a forgotten footnote by the 90s, much like Marvel's cosmic stuff in general.  It would surprise someone in 1996 to learn that in 20 years this footnote would spawn a major movie hit.

Regardless of what you or I may think to the quality and prospects of DC films going forward, Warners have to keep Snyder because nobody of sufficient talent and experience will be available AND willing to take this all on. 

They are fully committed, and they only thing they can do is try their hardest to make it work. The only thing they *could* do now is maybe drive a dump truck full of money to someone like Grant Morrison and ask them to get involved, but it would have to happen fast. Snyder is perfectly capable of delivering a good movie - I think Man of Steel was actually very good - but they have to let him work it all out now.

Fixed this for you.  If you're going to remove one of those billionaires, Lex is the obvious choice.  He was completely unnecessary in this movie that is supposed to be about Batman vs Superman.  Batman could have, and should have, been the one seeking out the Kryptonite and researching about alien technology.  He already had a perfect reason to take down Superman after the events of MoS.  Luthor's subplot with Martha and the whole Africa storyline was completely unnecessary to drive the plot forward and only wasted time (and completely butchered his character).

Alfred calls him out on this at one point, and I think that's when Bruce describes criminals as ""weeds."" Factoring in Superman and the loss of Robin (as well as prodding by Luthor), he sees fighting crime as an uphill battle that won't end, so he stops adhering to his rules.

And how that plays into him doubting himself but ultimately moving forward to do the right thing. Very heroic.

As a veteran, the whole ""Martha"" thing made a lot of sense to me. I saw it as a veteran who has PTSD triggers. For example vets who encountered IEDs come home and get triggered from cardboard boxes on the side of the road advertising yard sale. Why? Because it reminds them of boxes/containers used to hide bombs.

With Batman he is obviously traumatized and now fights crime as bats. So when Superman says Martha it triggers him, because it's his mom's name but also his father's last words. Beautiful.

Then there's the idea of power and corruption. Lex seems to think it corrupts all and goes to those unworthy, unlike him who deserves but doesn't get it. He envies Superman and hates him.

*Someone* is going to go that route eventually, and I'd like to see a major network take a risk for once.

Something like this:

Netflix builds an ""ESPN Stream"" channel. If you're a Netflix customer, you can load up this channel in your browser/on your device, and it will show you all current streams for the day as well as popular segments by age (presentation would go with some sort of weighting algorithm. New segments would push old segments off of the default display, but very, very popular segments would have additional staying power based on viewership).

You could ""subscribe"" to the ESPN Stream on your phone, and new segments that are in your interests would push notifications to you, either in real time, or every X minutes (user configurable).

All segments would be available as a real-time stream as they are uploaded. After that, they're available like any other video on Netflix.

I get what they were going for with it, but if they wanted to do the whole ""Maybe it's not great to dive into saving the whole world and showing everyone how OP you are"" thing, they could have done it in a way that didn't make them seem like huge assholes about it. There's a difference between telling your superpowered son to be cautious about letting others see him use his abilities and telling him ""maybe you should let all those people die, I dunno"".

That's a great line that shows how supportive and influential his mom is in his heroics!  I don't read a ton of Supes stuff, usually only what's in other hero's runs, do you know what comic it was from? I'd like to read it.",luminous_delusions

Superman is the quintessential American.  Truth, Justice, and the American Way right?  A huge part of that is the fact that he's an immigrant, he's not FROM America, but it doesn't matter because it's his Midwestern upbringing, not his heritage, that makes him who he is.  

Understanding Young Clark and the Kent family is VITAL to understanding Superman.  He's a motherhood-and-apple-pie doofus and we love him for it.  His superpowers are flight, x ray vision, freeze breath, and a complete and total lack of cynicism.  It's central to who and what he is.  

In these movies we have Pa Kent encouraging him to let *an entire bus of children die* because to save them would complicate his life.  

That's just... I don't have words for how wrong that is.  It's a worse mistake than letting batman kill with guns.  It's just 100% breaking the character into pieces.  ",djc6535

I would think that Batman has mixed feelings about killing his former protege if there's any hope to bring him back to sanity, which of course there isn't but Bruce may not think so.

That event could have also influenced Batman to be the killing, older and crueler version of himself, with him killing the (original) Joker as the first villain he ever felt the need to kill.

When taking the two most iconic superheroes and putting them in a movie together, beating a movie featuring a talking raccoon or a guy whose ability is to shrink to the size of an ant shouldn't be touted as an accomplishment.

The debate shouldn't have been whether it'd reach a billion dollars but whether it'd have the legs to surpass *The Avengers* and how close it could come to that one movie Disney released late last year featuring iconic characters that first appeared on the big screen in the 70s and 80s... but that would have required a movie good enough that contrarians comb through it looking for flaws rather than one bad enough that they comb through it looking for saving graces.",lunatickoala

They want Justice League right now, without ample time to build the universe or characters going into it. It's a cash grab and I'm glad it's backfiring. 

They are absolutely rushing the process. Justice League is supposed to start filming next week. Yet BvS' performance suggests that they need to take a step back and re-evaluate what they're doing with the DCEU. It's shocking to me how much control Snyder has when there was little to suggest in his record that he could carry an entire cinematic universe. Add the fact that Man of Steel underperformed and they still allowed him to make BvS as he wanted and we see now DC made a costly mistake. 

If they continue as planned with Snyder with full creative control, which is what is currently happening, Justice League will be plagued with much of the same problems as Man of Steel and BvS. DC should just step back for a moment, plan a solo Batman film and a few others before deciding to move into Justice League.

As always, the numbers are meaningless without context.  $700 million is not nothing, but it's well below what the studio was projecting and hoping for.  For a blockbuster on the level of BvS, especially one intended to be the cornerstone of a new cinematic universe, it's a problem.  You have to compare what it's making vs. what it cost, and what it was supposed to make.  And beyond just the money, the impact it was supposed to have.

This is the Amazing Spider-Man franchise all over again.  The two movies did make money, but not nearly as much as Sony was hoping they would.  They also got medicore-to-bad receptions, which dampened the mood of the public towards future projects which Sony had planned in that world, and which Sony ultimately scrapped.

The poor performance of BvS is certainly going to hobble any future DCEU movies by killing audience buzz.  Suicide Squad or whatever comes next is now going to have to prove it isn't BvS and can do better.",Monkeyavelli

But they had 3, maybe 5 years if they started pre-production on BvS right after Man of Steel, to put together at least a serviceable movie. All it needed was some scenes shifted around, some scenes fleshed out, some acting dialed back, some dialogue altered and for more of an emphasis to be made on the action scenes. 

As some reviewers have said, there are hints of a good movie in there. What came out was a meandering, aimless mess mixed with some of most bizarre plot decisions and impossibly boring action scenes I've seen in a long time. If they wanted to really to be a departure from Marvel the fight between Batman and Superman should have raged on for 20 minutes, not 5 minutes of a few kicks and punches and then a shitty 2 minute wrap up.

Like what it's like for Superman to be who he is when people doubt him, envy him, fear him, mistrust him. And how that plays into him doubting himself but ultimately moving forward to do the right thing. Very heroic.

There is absolutely no scene in which we're shown or told how Superman actually feels about being Superman. None. He has zero character arc throughout the entire film, he never hints at any underlying belief or ideology he actually holds about what it means to him to be a hero, he simply has other characters tell him what to do (2 that spout entirely UN-heroic crap at him, again). He begins the movie making a mess to save someone for selfish reasons, we're told that if something bad happens to him he will become patently evil, and at the end he again needs a selfish reason to behave heroically.

> As a veteran, the whole ""Martha"" thing made a lot of sense to me. I saw it as a veteran who has PTSD triggers. For example vets who encountered IEDs come home and get triggered from cardboard boxes on the side of the road advertising yard sale. Why? Because it reminds them of boxes/containers used to hide bombs.
> 
> 
> 
> With Batman he is obviously traumatized and now fights crime as bats. So when Superman says Martha it triggers him, because it's his mom's name but also his father's last words. Beautiful.

If what we're shown in that scene is intended to be ""Batman has a PTSD attack"", then the filmmakers have absolutely no idea what a panic attack is. People suffering from panic disorders don't become so mentally unstable as to abandon clearly held, well justified ideological positions just to immediately take them back on as they use their ""trigger"" to boost them into superhuman one-man ultra-tactical SWAT team mode while cracking jokes.

I'm really hesitant to point this out, because god knows Marvel stuff has been needlessly brought up in waaaaaay too many conversations about this movie, but it's just too appropriate here. Did Iron Man 3 do the most wonderful, deep, affecting take on a ""superhero"" with PTSD? Not really, but at least you could actually say they did get into it. 

> Then there's the idea of power and corruption. Lex seems to think it corrupts all and goes to those unworthy, unlike him who deserves but doesn't get it. He envies Superman and hates him.

You're right, there's the IDEA of power and corruption. That's it. The idea. Again, there is NOTHING there beyond it and it's never discussed. Is Lex right? We're supposed to believe he's not, because he's Lex Luthor, but we're never told or shown why beyond ""he's the bad guy"", even though both the ""good guys"" also have blood on their hands, arguably WAY MORE BLOOD. Batman completely agrees, until he doesn't, again for no good reason beyond we know him and Superman should be friends because they're the ""good guys"".
 
I mean, are you really putting forward the idea that this movie operates on a deep, psychological level because the bad guy experiences ENVY?

> Lots more.

I doubt it.

Look, you like the movie. That's fine, that's GREAT actually. Sincerely, more power to you. However, you're not doing yourself or the movie any favors by pretending it's something it's not. It's crappy. It's a sloppy, bloated, lazy mess that is very, verrrrry dumb. And it's great if people like it anyways. There's nothing wrong with liking stuff that's bad and/or stupid. God knows I do. But don't feel like you can't accept that and still enjoy something.

The Avengers (much like Superman in BvS) don't develop well as characters, they leave that to their solo films mostly. And any apparent character progression (like that with Hawkeye, Tony, Banner and Black Widow's relationship) felt forced and not very earned, much like Superman. Also, I didn't like the dialogue in BvS any less the overly-snarky wise-cracking dialogue in AoU, especially Ultron's dialogue.

What sets them apart is that Ultron was a very weak character all around, and Batman was leagues more interesting. The cinematography  and the soundtrack were much better in BvS as well. But above all, it was the fight scenes. Marvel typically fail to deliver fight scenes that are nearly as well- choreographed or well-shot as Zack Snyder. And even though Wonder Woman was awesome in action,  that was cancelled out by how uninteresting Doomsday is.

Now I'm not trying to act like BvS was far superior to AoU or anything. After all, AoU was far better edited which is the main reason why it's far more coherent. And even though AoU was much more fun, I liked BvS just a bit more and found it more entertaining overall.",BiDo_Boss

I highly doubt anyone could repeat it's success.

1. It's Kevin Feige's brainchild. The dude is just insane.
2. It was directed by Joss Whedon. He's *the perfect director* for this kind of movie given his background as both a director, AND a comic book author.
3. Joss Whedon did *not* have to put up with any kind of executive meddling because the heads of marvel studios and he saw completely eye-to-eye.
4. Marvel came from a point where they were forced to start small and then build up to a crown jewel like The Avengers. They couldn't start big like WBs is trying to do.
5. Marvel did not try to enter into the game late, and didn't have any kind of shareholders seeing a late start as ""money lost"".
6. Marvel didn't have a hyper-successful yard-stick to measure themselves against. You have no idea how much easier that makes just about *everything*.
7. Marvel is a comics company breaking into the movie industry. This means their initial focus was on protecting their comic IP from bad movies, rather than leveraging their comic IP to make profitable movies.

DC is simply not run by people capable of doing what Marvel has done. DC's president came from her management of the Harry Potter franchise. I've got plenty of respect for J.K Rowling, but Harry Potter doesn't have the cultural baggage of the DC heroes. This difference alone is going to make this climb an up-hill battle.

Meanwhile, DC doesn't have a director like Joss Whedon to helm their flagship products. On *top* of which, WB has *never* had the stones to *not* fuck with big projects. I mean, just try to read about the bullshit they pulled on the Hobbit movies. They're almost as bad as Fox when it comes to having things ""their way"" to the determent of a property.

Finally, shareholders fuck everything up. This is where Marvel lucked out by getting in early. They literally started running a race before anyone even knew the event was being organized. This allowed them to ramp up their universe slowly in an industry where everyone wants everything cheaper and yesterday.

I'm not trying to defend WB. I'm just trying to explain why the DC movies *cannot ever* be as good as their Marvel counterparts. Marvel was simply in the right place, at the right time, with the right people, doing the right things, with zero competition, and zero pressure to do anything *but* the best possible job they could.",Arandmoor

They featured Bucky prominently and made him one of the best characters in the whole damn series. They made Peggy a capable hero in her own right and gave us two seasons of her on TV.  They try to capitalize on every once of a character's potential (except maybe with the villains). 

DC doesn't even have the decency to properly adapt Robin/Nightwing, who is one of their oldest and most recognizable heroes. Or Jimmy Olsen, one of Superman's key supporting characters.

I don't understand this complaint in the least.  Movie-making is more than dialogue.  So rather than do an expository scene where Batman explains what happened to Robin, Snyder showed it in one three second scene.  Everybody knows who Robin is (for better or worse), so it doesn't take much for the general audience to draw from point A to point B here.  This is actually *good* film-making, using all of the tools at your disposal to tell your story.

> Or Superman hating Batman for his methods, despite them being exactly the same.

They weren't exactly the same.  Superman didn't kill or maim.  The difference in their methods was explicitly stated in two scenes as well: In Clark's argument with Perry White as well as in his first meeting with Bruce at the party.

>Or expecting the audience to care about Superman's fate, despite him being a hated godfigure and a bit of a selfish bully throughout the movie, only to be universally loved in the end inexplicably.

Superman wasn't universally hated.  The entire point was the split that people had between those who saw him as a god and those who saw him as a devil, while Superman himself simply did not yet know how to handle it.  He *just wanted to help*.  That's what made his sacrifice powerful at the end, as he finally came to terms with that.

Sick of people whining that it was 'joyless' and 'dark'. Batman movies are dark. Deal with it. It's what makes them different and have actual weight. 

Superman was campy in the original movies. But, hell, even the Superman from Superman Returns (honestly one of the most JOYLESS movies I've ever paid to see in theaters. As in, I wanted to walk out the whole time) was a broody, truly emo bitch. With less reason than the Supes we have in BvS. At least with Synder's Superman has the whole world suspicious and hating him. As opposed to, oh, Lois got knocked up when I wasn't around for years. Do we really need to see Superman flying Lois through the air Aladdin style for us to connect with him? 

 All of these people that didn't see BvS cause it seemed too serious are the same people that probably haven't seen Antman cause it's 'too silly'. Despite a generally positive word of mouth. ",None

It is not good filmmaking. Showing a graffitied Robin costume without context answers exactly one question while raising a ton of others. Is Robin dead, or just retired? Did the Joker kill Robin because comics or did Lex do it because we see later on that Lex loves him some graffiti? Did Joker or Lex break into the Batcave and graffiti the costume, or was it on him when he died and Batman never bothered to clean it up as a reminder or something? If the movie expects the audience to be familiar with the comics enough that they know the Joker killed Robin, why does it expect us to buy Batman killing people when comics Bats has endured worse than his partner dying?

Point 2:

Supes punches a terrorist through a wall, killed Zod in the previous film, his fight with Zod caused people to die, as we see in in the beginning of BvS, and he threatens Bats and Lex Luthor with similar bonebreaking/killing antics if they didn't do as Supes says. He has no right to consider himself morally superior to Bats.

Point 3:

We never see Supes in a real positive light. The only time we see him truly emotionally invested is either when Lois or his mother is in danger, otherwise he seems to care very little about anyone else. The montage of Superman saving people is treated like an obligation or burden, he doesn't save Jimmy Olsen in time, and he remains stony-faced and emotionally detached despite *seeing dozens of innocent people killed in an explosion.* 

Add in the nightmare sequences where Superman becomes a dictator or something, and he comes across less like a symbol of hope and more of a selfish bully, doing the bare minimum to make his mom and only friend happy, unwillingly saving just enough people to make everyone not completely hate him, but he's perfectly fine threatening and hurting those who stand little chance against him, who could snap and murder the planet at any moment if you take away his girlfriend and mom.

Because we never really see Supes saving more people with any emotional investment (besides Lois), his fight and sacrifice against Doomsday seems less a sacrifice to save the world and more a sacrifice to save two people. Had Lois and Martha died, it feels like Superman would let Doomsday raze the world.

And even if you're right, and he really did sacrifice himself for humanity and their sins or something, why would he become so beloved in the end? I'm surprised there wasn't Westboro Baptist-style protesters at his funeral, as he sacrificed himself to fight yet another Kryptonian that caused tons of devastation.  I have a very strong feeling that his resurrection is not going to be treated with jubilation, but fear and controversy.",Dalek_Kolt

No one is whining that is was dark.  People are whining that it was joyless.  Therefore, it was a slog to get through.  No one minds darkness in the Nolan Batman trilogy because they were fun.  

BvS was a chore to watch because the dark tone literally *never* changes.  Even the best comedies have some moments of legitimate drama or stakes.  Some of the most depressing movies ever have some moments of being uplifting or having levity.  People complain all the time about Marvel's tone; Marvel knows when to get dark too.  BvS is just dark and that's all it has to offer.  It doesn't help that the film is just boring.  So it's dark and it doesn't even try to excite you.  That's what people are complaining about.

Not a single one of those questions matters in the context of the story that was happening now.  The only thing that matters is that something bad happened to Robin... He could actually still be alive, for all we know.  Something bad happened to him and Batman is more violent as a result.  Simple, concise, to the point.  Phenomenal directing that you're trying to add too much to in your mind.

Point 2:

The terrorist who Superman punched didn't die.  All that means is that Superman did something to lessen the blow (which we wouldn't see, as fast as he was moving), or Zack Snyder has as much of a grasp about how hard a rock wall is as JJ Abrams has about how big outer space is... Either way, not dead.  Every battle he was in (in this movie), his first focus was on saving lives, showing how much he learned from Man of Steel.  The first thing he did against Doomsday was to launch him into space, away from the city.

Point 3:

I absolutely saw Superman in a positive light... Not quite the Superman that we know, the beacon of light for us to aspire to, but we see him moving to become that.  He absolutely cared and wanted to help... it's always been outside people who wondered it it was worth it.  His problem was having difficulty in coming to terms with how the public treated him as some kind of divine being.

>The montage of Superman saving people is treated like an obligation or burden

I didn't see that at all... It was a powerful montage in how it not only showed him helping people, but also in showing how godlike (or devil-like) the people saw him as.

> and he remains stony-faced and emotionally detached despite seeing dozens of innocent people killed in an explosion.

I have no idea where you get this from.  In the movie I saw, he looked guilty because he didn't react in time and sad that somebody would kill other people to get at him.  Cavill might not be the most emotionally expressive actor out there, but he *nailed* that scene, in my eyes.

>Had Lois and Martha died, it feels like Superman would let Doomsday raze the world.

That's... I don't even know where you get that.  It might be a legitimate interpretation though, because it fits with his arc, in how some people, Lex included, absolutely did see him as a devil, not a savior.

>why would he become so beloved in the end?

He died to save the world from a monster.  Even if it didn't change *everybody's* minds, it changed enough to significantly sway public opinion.  Having Westboro-style protesters there would have diluted the pendulum shift that they were showing, as not only was public opinion turned, but Batman was also inspired to be better and to no longer be cruel, setting up a much more ""traditional"" core for the Justice League.  I find it much more interesting to have seen these characters progress to that with actual character arcs than to just have them appear as the icons we know them as.",TBoarder

I was being a bit caustic and you could have fired back, but that was a very coherent response. 

I agree with you, partially, about the statement concerning 'dark' vs 'joyless'. Call me tweaked, but I like gritty, serious, and even bleak. Watchmen, in my opinion, was a fantastic movie that embodied all of the above. And no, I am not a Snyder super fan. (300 was overrated, Suckerpunch is deserving of ALL of this BvS hate, IMO) 

You could argue that the movie wasn't 'fun', but to me it was thrilling. I was glued to the screen. Superman isn't a FUN superhero, in my opinion. How can he be? You can't just throw the next, strongest villain in his path because, let's face it, he's OP. It's always a question of how they're going to incorporate kryptonite. Or what new power he'll pull out of his supercheeks. That's why BvS and Man of Steel, for that matter, made me actually want to watch him on the big screen. It is the DRAMA from Superman that is appealing. The conflict of the world's view (and take) of this god-like alien. His true intent. 

The best parts of BvS were that it was a different perspective of Man of Steel. Literally. In MoS we had Superman saving the day. Saving Earth from literal destruction. In BvS we see that from the other side. From Wayne's perspective, literally. The opening of the movie really set the stage for why he has distrust. Why the world would rally and fear Superman and his godlike powers. This is the conflict of Superman and what makes his story so captivating. 

I know that this movie wasn't funny and the tone doesn't change, as you said. But I kind of didn't notice or want it to, personally. Lex, as obnoxious as Eisenberg can be, had his moments. Alfred's interaction with Batman brought levity. I feel like to betray the overall serious tone of the movie is to cop out. To pander. It doesn't need funny jokes. It doesn't need tongue in cheek references. This is the darkness before the dawn. The future movies will bring humor to the DCU, I guarantee it. This was also the death of Superman (kinda). But WB is already crapping their big boy pants and you likely have heard they are already reshooting Suicide Squad. Again, likely to pander to a bigger audience. 

I found the movie plenty exciting. But I will say this. DC movies are more intense and exhausting, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I like the experience. That's what it is, a thrill ride. Dark and brooding. It's not something I really want (or need) to see back to back repeat viewings of. Maybe a slog, like you said, but I think it's by design. Silly as that sounds. Maybe that's what's hurting the follow up showings. 

I enjoy Marvel movies, a lot. Saw Deadpool this weekend and already want to see it again. I don't get that way with DC, per se. Even when they're as good as the Dark Knight or Batman Begins. Though, in the end, I prefer the latter. ",None

That's the big part of it, this 9/11 Commission-esque group and, by extension, Batman are worried about future attacks. That ""1%"" chance of this outsider doing something to harm Americans.

That, to me, is our struggle with Islamophobia in a microcosm. The othering of a specific group for the actions of a few who are not absolutely not representative of the whole.

Kinda does. Because I still think Lex somehow killed Robin because of the graffiti thing, or that Luthor was in the Batcave because graffiti newspapers. 

>The terrorist who Superman punched didn't die.

And the thugs Batman tossed a car on are still alive. On that note, there's *nothing* that suggests that Superman has learned from killing Zod. See; Him threatening Batman after the chase, and him giving the seemingly defenseless Luthor the ""mercy"" of not breaking him.

>I have no idea where you get this from. In the movie I saw, he looked guilty because he didn't react in time and sad that somebody would kill other people to get at him.

Maybe if Superman smiled or emoted more often, I could pick up on the subtle (nonexistent) emotion Superman felt, but you know what I saw? Dr. Manhattan ""reacting"" to a pregnant woman that the Comedian shot. That is, no reaction.

>I don't even know where you get that.

One of my favorite lines from Bruce is how Superman gets a fluff piece written about him every time he saves a cat from a tree. No such scene in the actual movie. I guess it'd be because it isn't ""godlike"" or ""devillike"" enough for the movie. 

Anyway, I get that because that montage is the only time you see Superman saving people besides Lois. Do we see how Superman feels about it? No, he's shot from the people's POV, and I honestly can't tell if Superman enjoys it. Ergo, obligation/burden on Superman's part.

>He died to save the world from a monster.

By the movie's own admission, no one was there to see his sacrifice besides three people. No one knows how truly threatening Doomsday  was, Superman was still being controversial over that stupid Capitol bombing, as far as the people know, the weird disconnected alien that could wipe out the planet is dead.

I've always interpreted that scene as Jonathan knowing that Clark couldn't just let them die, but also being afraid of how the world would react to his son--the reality we see come to light in BvS. 

There are many flaws in the way they executed that message, especially in BvS, but I think his Dad's message made for an interesting dilemma in Superman's development. But I agree with you that its execution in BvS leaves the entire message feeling shallow and rushed.",QuickDraw2406

If you want entertainment providers to create original content, you have to stop consuming nostalgia based goods.  Remakes / Reboots / Sequels play off your nostalgia.  

In the modern world there are more entertainment choices available to you than you can shake a stick at.  And it's increasing every moment.  You increase the number of choices, you dilute the quality.  

When they make these sequels and remakes, it gives a product a monetary support.  Remakes and sequels have a built in audience.  They don't need to establish themselves again for your sake.  

This situation was created by our demand for entertainment.  The market has become saturated, so now we have to sift through piles of shit to get to the golden nuggets.

Decades ago the serial was the way stories and movies were delivered to us.  It's more of the same now only instead of the story or a cliffhanger bringing you back, it's the hype and nostalgia for the story and characters.  

Think about it whats the most important number to Hollywood?  Opening day numbers.  After that, who gives a fuck.  They don't care about delivering entertaining thoughtful media, they are a marketing company selling you a product you don't really need to consume.  Only thing they are concerned about is profit.

In my opinion opening day movie going is the stupidest thing you can do.  Don't go to a movie based on a trailer, go based on what your trusted critics, friends and coworkers say about it.  There are always people that go to the opening day of movies, but holy god, I don't want to waste my Saturday night watching 2.5 hours of drivel.

This is all consequence of the ever expanding communication avenues.  It's no longer up to the entertainers to entertain you.  It's up to you to find your own entertainers.  If you want quality entertainment you have to look for it, and speak with your wallet.",Colbeagle

For recommendations I'd suggest looking into the Imdb top 250, which is a good start because it's a pretty mainstream list.
