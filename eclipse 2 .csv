* **Transformers: The Last Knight** - As I mentioned last week, TLK was under-performing in every market besides China. Well it seems that while the opening was huge the vast majority of Chinese people are done with the franchise as the film dropped 82% this weekend in China. That's not only the biggest drop for a Transformers film in the country but one of the biggest ever for an American release. It seems to be an extreme reaction from the audience as the film received a terrible score on their IMDB equivalent Douban, one of the worst for a major release. China seemed to be the saving grace for the franchise but at this rate the franchise is in dire straits, even as T5 approaches $500M worldwide. 

* **The Big Sick** - The film continues to have incredible returns as it inches it's way towards a wide release. This weekend it played in 71 theater earning $1.67M, a per theater average of $23,550. It's still on track for a wide release in two weeks. 

**Notable film closings** 

* **Hidden Figures** - The surprise hit of the Oscar season has closed to a phenomenal $169.3M domestic and	$230.2M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film debuted in wide release in January to a respectable $22.8M but had some of the best drops for a wide release in years, dropping less than 30% for it's first 9 weeks in wide release. The film had some of the best legs I've ever seen with a multiplier of 7.4x and a per theater average that didn't drop below $1,000 until week 19. This film was a major victory (alongside Get Out) for films starring black protagonists and a testament to the power of crowd pleasing biopics.

* **The Case for Christ** - The latest Pure Flix vehicle has closed to a solid $14.6M domestic and $15.4M worldwide on a budget of $3M. The company's first biopic received fairly good reviews and bucked the trend of some of their recent flops and while it didn't make God's Not Dead money the film still came out very profitable. At this point Pure Flix are the only other company constantly playing with the Blumhouse model of small scale releases with the occasional big hit bankrolling the entire company, and it's working very well for them.

This has worried me too. August is usually much kinder to original films and non established franchises than June and July have been. And while that A- Cinemascore is very good, it probably would have been much better if it was a full A. It also hurts that its R rated, and in family months like these that's not really a good sign. 

We'll see how it does next week, especially going against *Spider-Man: Homecoming*. If it keeps steady then as well, *Baby Driver* could do similar R rated late June business like *Magic Mike*, *The Heat*, *This is The End* and a few more did. ",BPsandman84

So much of that movie is dumb and unnecessary. When the German soldiers storm the Amazon's beach, why do they all give up the high ground and jump down to be completely level with the enemy?

Why do they jump off a horse, do a 360 McTwist, and then shoot arrows? It doesn't make any sense.

Chris Pine's group of friends serve next to no purpose. Oh, here's a Native American character in the front lines of WWI because that makes sense. Their presence makes no sense.

When walking head-first into machine gun fire, how is it possible that all of those bullets go precisely to her wrists? 

That movie was garbage. I honestly think critics were afraid of being called a sexist for panning it but that really is what it deserved. It was just a genuinely bad movie. Cheesy and dumb.

Even when I heard about Memento, it had that hook, just a juicy little tidbit that made you want to go see it without giving the whole movie away. 

Dunkirk just seems like a war rescue story, like the 3 of 4 recent movies where ordinary people go out to preform an extraordinary rescue.

I honestly couldn't tell you who the lead is. Also, we're talking Spielberg and Hanks, Nolan isn't quite up there yet with ubiquity of brand. 

What I don't understand is how the marketing for Nolan films have been so bad -- I wonder if he just really wants to keep things under wraps. All I can remember from interstellar is just a Michael Caine voiceover, McConaughey driving a pickup, and random shots of Anne Hathaway.

Dunkirk wasn't satisfying for anyone involved. The British rescued most of their manpower but lost all of their equipment. The Germans pushed the British back to their island but failed to destroy the British army. The battle was a delay in the war, not a conclusion to anything.

Even in Empire Strikes Back, where the Empire thoroughly trounced the Rebellion, there were still gains made by the protagonists. Luke became a Jedi during this movie and learned that his father was a different man than his daddy. This movie was primarily about Luke's character development at a high cost; Echo Base destroyed, Yoda dies, Han Solo frozen and captured, and of course the loss of Luke's right hand and the loss of his lightsaber.

Unlike Empire Strikes Back which is a dark movie where the antagonists win, Dunkirk would be a movie where the protagonists retreat without accomplishing anything at all. ",Hyndis

German forces were able to drive the British back to their island and captured British war materiel, but they failed to decisively destroy the British army.

Dunkirk was a battle without a resolution; merely a postponement. The two forces would again meet in combat.

Shouldn't it be a problem for any director if your story has no narrative?

The trailers really don't show any arc or line or any pattern. Just a collage of shots.  I'm sure it will be technically amazing, but so was Avatar, and at least that had a narrative. 

It's basically Pearl Harbor minus the love triangle. Michael Bay competently portrayed the action scenes there. 

But you know what's more compelling? Documentaries and shows about WWII and even books. I ***personally*** don't want to sit for 2.5 hours paying $17.75 for IMAX to watch recreation of action pieces with characters I don't care about. 

The Hurt Locker's sniper scene was just 2v2, a lot of quiet, but full of intensity and high stakes. Still ""war."" Still tension. 

When Ralph Fiennes showed up, he was the second guy after Guy Pearce I recognized, and I felt a comfort with him on screen since I obviously knew him among unknowns. I think he was cast for his likeness, because when he was shot and killed within 10 minutes, I felt something new I hadn't felt watching action films -- actual bit of fear, it felt like I watched a friend in a strange land with no one I know get shot and killed from someone somewhere unseen. An unknown would have no impact. He was a huge name. 

I feel crazy in wanting a narrative...and you can't criticize Nolan without getting downvoted to irrelevance/silence. 

I've always had a theory that Nolan's filmography has been dependent on whether they were adapted from something or original stories. Inception and Interstellar had absolutely amazing ideas I feel that many screenwriters thought ""damn, he wasted a great concept on a terrible story.""

It's why I don't mind if he remakes a Bond film. He's not particularly imaginative or original with stories, as his best stories are borrowed to some degree. 

IMO, Inception's 2 main problems are 1) no real narrative, other than Cobb needs to get home but in the end he doesn't care if he's actually home or dreaming, and literally NO other characters changed from their first to their last minute, and 2) it was visually unimaginative. My dreams definitely aren't clear like that; I definitely can't read in dreams, I can't walk and talk with everything clear -- dreams are more visceral than visual; you see something but you feel an emotion to it, you feel what your conversation was about with perhaps some semblance of words. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind does a better job depicting absurdity of what dreams feel like even though they're memories; like the faceless employees, or tiny Joel under the table, or large objects flying away...I feel like dreams are closer to that. 

And Interstellar...ugh. Despite the controversial climax, I felt far more enthralled and in awe of the enormity of space watching Contact for the first time since 1997 in 2014 after Interstellar, and 97% of Contact takes place on Earth. Again, IMO interstellar failed from lack of imagination. The planets just seemed too...Earth-like. I feel like there would be some form of life on those planets. ",Death_Star_

""Hiding."" That's the thing. 

It's not intentional hiding. It's ""natural selection"" due to Nolan's method of film-making, which doesn't lend itself well to well-made trailers in *any* of the most popular conventional forms. 

Why?

Because Nolan's films just don't have scenes that are both exciting but non-essential/spoiler. His films are dense, the content-less shots don't excite anyone (like the Dark Knight opening scene with IMAX shots of shiny buildings). The filler scenes are really boring. In the Dark Knight Rises, Bruce/Batman is either doing something spoiler-heavy (fighting Bane, fighting alongside Robin, fighting Bane, trying to escape the prison) or boring (his scenes with Catwoman at her place, where he's just having conversations, they don't fit in a trailer). 

The Prestige is worse. 

Look at this  [HORRIBLE TRAILER](https://youtu.be/o4gHCmTQDVI) for The Prestige. It's not exciting, it's cut like it's used to cause seizures, none of it makes sense as a narrative. 

The Prestige trailer had to be cut that way because it couldn't be cut without spoiling or boring the viewers. Like when Borden argues about tying a more difficult knot -- it makes no sense in a trailer. But then Borden being asked at a funeral what knot he tied by Angier makes it look like he murdered Angier's wife, which spoils, but misleads the viewer into thinking that's what the movie is about. 

The Prestige would gross $500 million today based on everyone's reputation (it was 1 year after Bale was Batman and 6 years after American Psycho, a cult hit. It was only 6 years since Jackman was Wolverine for the first time -- he just finished his 17th year as Wolverine. 

But the film was barely OK commercially but much better on DVD due to word of mouth. 

Why? Because no one knew what the hell it was about. The Prestige doesn't sound like a magician movie. The trailers were awful like above. Reviews were good. Word of mouth was good.... but it was pre Twitter and pre Facebook being #1. 

**His movies are so dense with so many different scenes necessary to make up the story that no single trailer can be shown in a ""normal fashion"" without boring or spoiling people.** 

It's why Warner Bros was forced to skip trailers and instead promote both Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises with the actual opening scenes available online before the movie release, like the joker robbery scene and the Bane crashing the plane. 

They figured that rather than spoil a whole movie or most of it, they might as well show the most of a 6 minute scene that's not totally crucial to the film and something where if you caught 5 seconds of it in a trailer, you would know what would end up happening. 

Like, Bane in a plane like that is surviving and crashing it to survive if we see a glimpse. And they show it all instead. 

Showing Bruce in a prison makes it obvious that he will break out somehow. 

Showing one masked clown carelessly gun down his associates makes it obvious it's the joker. So they show the whole scene. 

The trailers were awful. Full of either spoiler scenes (the football field is definitely imploding, especially with it being the only scene featuring football, the mayor is getting blown up, Batman gets his back broken etc) or nonsense (Catwoman, presumably because we don't see her face, falling backwards out of a window, catwoman doing a weird cartwheel in a men's prison). 

The interstellar trailers were the worst.  They didn't spoil a thing but they didn't show anything interesting. 

I'm sorry, but the same shot of McConaghey crying while driving his pick up in all 3 trailers in a movie called INTERSTELLAR doesn't sell me on the film. 

I just remember a lot of dust and then random space shots and nothing interstellar. 

**TLDR Nolan's films are so densely packed that marketing them is near impossible without spoiling or boring viewers. It's like 90% spoiler scenes and 10% filler scenes.**

The overlap between Nolan's own films between TDK and TDKR (I leave off Batman Begins because it's such a low performer) and his other films made after TDK is only about 70%. That means 30% of the box office for the Nolan Batman films just vanishes when he works on anything else.

On the other hand, the average Avengers film does twice the box office that a Nolan film does, which means there's not much proven overlap between comic book movies in general and Nolan films in general at all.

Furthermore, Saving Private Ryan, which was a *uniquely* successful war movie, did 630 million in inflation-adjusted box office while Spider-Man, released a couple years later, did 1.1 billion dollars in box office.

Basically, Wonder Woman's box office is likely going to do better than the best non-Batman Nolan film ever made, there's no evidence the same audience watches the same movies in significant numbers, therefore the only real threat to Wonder Woman's dominance is a big tent blockbuster with an untarnishable franchise that does huge box office no matter its quality -- Spider-Man.

The fact is though, Christopher Nolan is almost a genre upon himself, this sub is the perfect example of that. The 18-25 demographic (same one that loves superheroes) thinks he's literally the best director ever and he has a rabid following since TDK. Expect Dunkirk will do similar to Inception and Interstellar, as it's rated PG-13 and not R, as Saving Private Ryan was.

My first thought was “Oh this is a FILM!” This was, I believe, after that stunning light speed moment, it had spent a lot of time building up the noon force users in the rebellion, including new characters leia was dead, and Poe who I really enjoyed was stepping up into a leadership role, and I was so intrigued at the possibility of this power couple of Rey and Kylo who were both full of raw strength and not much training in actual Jedi philosophy kind of setting up their own faction and maybe they’re more gray than most Star Wars villains. But also that idea that Rey gets to be so effortlessly powerful, in a way that most standard heros aren’t, is because she’s not a hero, and no longer our protagonist but this natural disaster that some random pilot is gonna have to rally the troops to face, is Finn gonna have to pick up that lightsaber again, try and fail to access the force, and yet embody the Jedi ethos more powerfully than Rey can.

I only saw Mortal Engines once in cinemas, and after a few days I didn't think about it much ever again, but it had this *really* interesting minor antagonist called Shrike who I still vividly remember and who instantly popped to mind with this question. He's one of the last surviving members of an ancient ""race"" of zombie terminators created out of people's corpses - the idea being that their memories and emotions were erased completely, making them heartless killing machines. The villains have him imprisoned in the middle of the ocean but unleash him at the beginning of the second act because he's mysteriously hellbent on hunting the protagonist, who has just escaped from them.

As it turns out, it's because he actually *adopted* her when she was orphaned as a child. He began raising her and caring about her in a very un-heartless way, but lacked the human empathy to help her cope with her trauma - so instead, he offers to resurrect her as a zombie terminator too, in order to erase the pain she feels of losing her mother. She willingly *agrees* and promises to let him do this, but then leaves, and backstory/movie plot happens that I don't remember.

During the brief moments we actually get to see him hunting, he's completely unstoppable and immortal in the face of everything that's thrown at him as he tracks her down, and somehow finds her on a flying sanctuary fortress and singlehandedly burns down the entire thing on his warpath. But when he catches up with her at last, the thing that finally actually kills him is simply that she refuses to keep her promise to him, and it literally *breaks the heart* of this ""heartless"" zombie machine-man. They both clearly still care about each other as he dies, too. It was poignant and beautiful while also being an interesting commentary on humanity while *also* being creepy as anything.

And it was the end of ACT 2, for some reason. The actual ""climax"" might be the most generic third act of a blockbuster that I've ever watched in my life. This absolutely fascinating character, who could have easily been a brilliant major villain, was actually just a background antagonist who had somewhere between 10-20 minutes of screentime in this *whole movie* and was basically never mentioned or relevant to the plot outside of the brief moments he showed up. I know this movie was based on a book and I don't know how he's handled there, but I do know that he's far and away the most interesting character I've ever watched the plot and runtime of a film absolutely *shaft* in favour of a vastly more mediocre story.",TheMHBehindThePage

All of the vampire gang parts are so good. If they just made the movie about the gang rampaging around in late 80s America with a grey moral turmoil about how they have to kill to live while being hunted by vampire slayers, it would have been great. Instead they take that moral question and give it to the guy who is supposed to be the protagonist but actually is just an annoying little bitch with problematic approaches with women. There’s a reason Bill Paxton is on the poster, because his part of the movie is so much cooler than the guy who is actually the main character.

For those of you who haven’t seen the film, the plot is based around a retired super special secret agent (JCVD) who is brought back in for one last mission to track down and capture an international bad guy. On this “last mission”, the bad guy gets the best of him and escapes. JCVD is captured and then taken to a secret island. This island serves as a kind of retirement village for the men formerly considered to be among the world’s most dangerous. JCVD then has to escape from this island and team up with an international arms dealer (Rodman) to pursue vengeance and complete his final mission.

By the end, I felt like given the right influence, he might have been possible to redeem and pull toward the light. I really wanted to know more about how he came to be a part of that group, and what might have influenced him to have a different life, if things had been different. It also got me thinking about what would happen if someone like him did change and want to become a better person -- how would they even do it? Would it be possible, after doing so many horrible things?

The first act of the movie does a very nice job setting up the middle quarters that is Breakfast Club adjacent, when a random group of kids (including the most popular kid in school) is thrown together arbitrarily, build connections, etc. with Paul Giamatti’s Paul Hunham there largely as a foil to them (albeit one who’s been given a good amount of setup and gets time to himself).

Then everyone but one of the kids gets literally picked up by a helicopter and disappears from the main plot entirely, and from the movie until the last few minutes.

I *love* the rest of *The Holdovers*, but it definitely goes from a complex tapestry to something much starker, and you feel the loss of that color and multi-faceted dynamics.

In this case, I think it accomplishes something like what *Pschyo* does after the first murder, and our audience sympathy transfers onto the much more prickly and ambiguous Norman. Building up and then snatching away all the youthful foolishness, hijinks, douchebaggeru, and camaraderie makes us more primed to sympathize with Angus’ rebellious assholery and see a complex friendship form between Angus and Paul, rather than expect a more straightforwardly heartwarming “young man and jaded old man learn from each other.”

Counterintuitively, I think it also solves the narrative problem of Angus being an old soul who’s not really the life of the party by making his shifting behavior across contexts the “interesting” thing. My favorite example is the mirroring of him breaking the rules by antagonizing Paul and running around the school mocking him, and him breaking the rules much more severely in some ways by stealing Paul’s key and…doing fundamentally harmless things, ending with him sitting respectfully in the chapel as Mary comes in.",SandpaperTeddyBear

Or use Helen because after she defeated Candyman, she basically took his place. It woulda been a nice full circle moment being haunted by the spirit of the woman who sacrificed herself to protect you.

Instead, we got a movie where Anthony (and we the audience) learn that Candyman is a legacy name given to ""hive"" of black men that were killed by the hands of racist white people. Oh, and the guy who tells him this? TURNS HEEL on him and proceeds to mutilate him then cause his death. Which makes him BECOME the newest Candyman. He can also be summoned.

Could've done the same with the Fantastic Beasts movies, maybe Newt would've been spending most of a movie trying to stop a bunch of poachers or something, and then in the finale it'd be revealed that the poachers are working for Wizard Hitler because Wizard Hitler wants to make a special potion using the magical ingredient that a certain magical creature provides.

As Gorr continues his onslaught, Zeus calls a council of the gods; the summons for Thor is tied to Mjolnir, not Stormbreaker (the joke is Zeus didn't update his contacts list), so Jane arrives.  Gorr attacks the council, and Thor arrives with the Guardians of the Galaxy to repulse him (wielding Mjolnir in *Endgame* left some residual trace that let the summons softly ping Thor but it took him a minute to figure out what that was).  The Guardians are beat up during the battle and agree that fighting Gorr again is above their pay grade, so they nope out.  Thor brings in Valkyrie (leave Korg at home to play his video games), recruits Hercules at Zeus' request (Gorr lands a blow on Zeus that doesn't kill him but incapacitates him enough to put him out of action; Valkyrie ""borrows"" his lightning bolt), and they eventually corner Gorr as he's about to slay another god (some deep-cut god that can show up as an ally in a future film).

I mean, a whole episode about a couple (when the shrinking stuff is first out there) hearing about it and eventually deciding to take the plunge. And them being the early adopters and considered freaks of nature. 

Then a different episode about another couple making the decision, except one backs out at the last minute, and the legal fight over it and their assets. 

A later episode about someone taking the shrink to get out of a crappy life as a maid on the outside, but their investments ‘go bad’ and they end up living a crappy life as a maid while shrunk (and unable to leave).

1:  In 'Mummy 2', Scorpion King is supposed to be a conquering Warlord.  Ok cool, I see it, you've got this guy who looks like a massive warrior leading ancient Armies.  Then in the Scorpion King movie, they're like ""oh yeah, he's an ancient Egyptian Ninja"".  Yeah, the 6'5, 260 pound mountain of muscle is definitely whom you would hire to sneak into places unnoticed and assassinate people.

2:  The Scorpion King is clearly supposed to be an evil, conquering warlord in the 'Mummy 2'.  I mean, the dude literally sells his soul to the God of Death to ensure victory.  And then in the movie, they're like ""nah, he's a hero now who saves people from an evil tyrant, and he's so charming that a woman risks her life and sacrifices her ability to see the future just to have sex with him"".

I'm not sure how complete it was, but a script is out there that would have been more in line with The Last Jedi, and Broom Kid becomes a featured character.

And I think Rey was supposed to remain a ""nobody"", which was far more in line with the themes the movies were already setting up, that the nature of The Force was changing, and it no longer belonged to any group of people, Sith or Jedi.

I don't absolutely hate Rise of Skywalker as much as apparently everyone else does, but when JJ Abrams took over as director, he basically did the same thing George Lucas did after Empire, and attempted a ""course correction"". 

So while both Empire and Last Jedi are more challenging films that raise the stakes super high and end on a (still hopeful) down note, Return of the Jedi and Rise of Skywalker both kind of abandon some of the loftier themes proposed in their previous films to bring it back to popcorn entertainment.

They do kiss and in most films, it would maybe linger a little longer or they would have eye contact they conveyed some sort of longing but there's just nothing. 

So at the end, when they get together, it literally seems to come out of nowhere. I can never understand why it was written that way. If the movie included even one moment of Eric Stoltz looking at Mary Stuart Masterson just a little too long, it would have perfectly conveyed that he was at least considering her or having some complex feelings about it - but they didnt.

She was clairvoyant in life and kept having visions, but nobody believed her and started to believe that Alice was the one causing bad things to happen because she always knew details about them. She has visions of her mother dying, but nobody believes it was murder. It turns out it was her new stepmother who murdered her mother to marry her wealthy father. Her stepmother plans to kill her, but she has no proof, and nobody will help her because they think she's a witch/bad luck/causing bad things to happen. Her stepmother convinces her father to institutionalize her to get her out of the way. 

She's basically tortured with electroshock therapy until she meets a vampire-nurse, who turns her to protect her from another vampire who wanted to kill her. She wanders and trains herself to not view humans as prey without Carlisle's help, because she knew she would have to do that in order to meet the Cullens.

First movie, some sexual tension with the other female agent, but they don't even kiss or anything.

Second movie, we get a 30 minute introduction that's dedicated to Ethan recruiting Thandie Newton, but it really just seems like an excuse for these two to bang. There's extreme sexual tension for the rest of the movie, and then they ride off into the sunset together.

Third movie, Thandie Newton is forgotten and Ethan is now engaged, but it's back to just being a mostly sweet romance where his fiancee gets dragged into a murder plot.

Fourth movie, they >!suggest that his fiancee has died before revealing that she's secretly alive and faked her death so that she can live in peace.!<

The thing is, I don’t know if this was the intent, but Ridley Scott also needs to stop playing the “Rome is being ruined by scheming queer politicians, and needs some no-nonsense military men to sort shit out” straight.  

Because literally the whole point of the political crisis Rome is about to go through in the 3rd century, is the army deciding it can rule without the rest of the society, and throwing up a series of no nonsense soldier emperors, to help them capture more and more of the state’s resources.  And it breaks everything.

Caracalla himself is one of these, who spent almost his entire life being raised in his father’s military camps, before ruling most of the time from military camps on the frontier.  His dad’s last words to his sons were famously “Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others”.  Now he didn’t follow through with the whole “be harmonious, don’t murder your brother” thing, but definitely checked off the enriching the soldiers and scorning all others boxes. 

Hmm, I wonder if there are any contemporary political events that might make us connect with the theme of questioning whether our desire for a strong man to lead us and break the system of politics as usual might not be a great thing?

Edit: We literally call this dude by his nickname “Caracalla” referring to a Gallic style soldier’s cloak, because he spent so much time in cold Northern Amy camps wearing one, instead of his legal name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.",Justin_123456

The difference would be that the Republic could struggle politically & ethically with whether or not to use some kind of super weapon (maybe even Luke himself - whom they need to find to power the weapon via the Force, let's say) to obliterate the fledgling First Order, & while they dither, the First Order attacks the Republic in a move similar to the Death Star trench run and secures enough of a victory to cripple the Republic, which again would be an inverse outcome of A New Hope, and subvert expectations as to what fans thought they'd see in Episode 7. Inversion & subversion in one fell swoop. 

And to your point, an interesting through-line for the ST would be industries siding with the First Order as it became apparent that they were gaining the upper hand. The subtext of a cause being righteous for some only in so far as it can make them money would add some complexity & moral ambiguity, which was only hinted at in The Last Jedi. 

Of course, would it have killed JJ & Lawrence Kasdan to give even a smidge of explanation about the First Order's status in The Force Awakens? Or even the current state of the galaxy's politics? Not finding out why the FO had such strong financial backing & military might (perhaps explained via Snoke's character),  or what the Republic's role in the galaxy was felt like a missed opportunity. Too much was glossed over & it ultimately felt unsatisfying, since the movie was an exercise in hitting the main beats of Star Wars.",ThereWillBWales

“Flash sideways”:
The final episodes feature an alternate timeline, called the “flash sideways,” where characters interact as if they were alive but with subtle hints of their past lives on the island, revealing their deceased status. 

Island as a purgatory:
The island itself is interpreted as a place where the characters were meant to confront their personal issues and prepare for their eventual “passing”. 

Jack’s sacrifice:
Jack is shown to sacrifice himself to save the island, leading to his death and arrival in the afterlife. 

Reunion and closure:

Lucas likes to say he had Star Wars planned out from the beginning, but if you listen to his collaborators it becomes very obvious that wasn't true. 

Lawrence Kasdan claims he came up with the Vader is Luke's father twist. Luke was originally going to have a sister training in another part of the Galaxy who wasn't Leia. The OT was originally going to go past three films with Luke turning to the Dark Side.

All the twists and changes came as the movies were being written and made. There was a longer screenplay that Lucas broke up into parts, adapting the first act into the first Star Wars, but it's very different from what we ended up getting by Return of the Jedi.

Disney (and JJ by extension) just didn't have the balls to go where Last Jedi had set them up for. JJ's got his good points as a writer/producer/director, but at the end of the day he played it too safe.",sauronthegr8

It definitely *feels* set in the late 00s (they buy flip phones, have a meeting in a cybercafe, and need to have 9/11 explained to them) but I don't think that's a bad thing. They are displaced in time anyway, so feeling a little ""off"" and retro in terms of timeframe is okay.

Some of it might actually work better now than it did back then. I remember it being difficult for them to get hold of certain new powerful GPUs, and that a chess-playing AI had ""moods"". Probably worth a rewatch now moody AIs are more like everyday life than sci-fi and everybody understands the relevance of powerful GPUs.

There was a lull in the second season due to the writer's strike, but it ended strongly. On a cliffhanger if that bothers you. Some interesting philosophical questions come up, and they do a couple of things that I haven't seen other shows do (>!for instance, killing a main character instantly mid-scene with no fanfare and just carrying on, Derek and Jesse discovering they weren't each other's Derek and Jesse, and Jesse's mission basically being a mirror of a Terminator's mission!<). There are a few episodes that show ""flashbacks"" of the future war.

I’m probably not remembering all the details but basically he lied about his age to participate in the civil war, on the wrong side. He encountered 3 vampires thinking they were early teens. They changed him because they could tell he’d have special powers. 

Then, he helped train and turn humans into vampires. They’d kill all of them before they were 1 in vampire years, either fighting in the “vampire wars” (which were fought for good territory to hunt humans), or just straight murdering them at 1 year because their strength waned at 1 year. 

He encountered a vampire he grew fond of (it’s also implied he had a weird relationship with one of the vampires who turned him, again supposed to be a young teen) in a platonic way. Refused to kill him and let him go. Left the vampire wars because he was tired of killing. Quit drinking human blood because he was tired of killing. 

Eventually, he finds Alice who had a vision she would meet him. They all meet up with the rest of the Cullen to tell them they’re family now, out of the blue.",highheelcyanide

Fighting off that standard sort of immortal ennui that is a common trope, with the added bit of 'if I become too aloof it will be harder to remember why I don't eat them'.

I think the books also say that they don't always do high school, sometimes they do just go straight to college or working, or some will branch off and live as married couples and skip the school. Then between living 'normal' lives they go live apart for chunks of time, like in I think Alaska with that other group of vampires that don't eat people.

Also, to be fair, they are all beautiful, not going through puberty or dealing with teen insecurities, they already know the content so it isn't a struggle academically, they are *bored* and looking to fill their lives with things to do, and they are rich while having a built-in supportive social group in their 'siblings', so their high school experience isn't really the standard sort of unpleasant many people get.",Mindelan

Nolan did Oppenheimer for half that budget and was very successful against a blockbuster competitive release.

Regarding the characters, we as an audience were supposed to connect with the main characters and that's literally why we learned about their backstories as a way to resonate with them. However, this did nothing for me, as the entirety of the first and second movies were rushed. In fact, I was actually rooting for Noble to win. When Noble got his head cut off, i was devastated but was like ""okay maybe they'll kill Kora off and even the stakes but no instead we got the random blonde dude and nemesis killed. This reminds me of the plot armor that we've seen on Rey in Star Wars and how she magically navigates her way through every goddamn thing that's thrown at her. Like imagine how enticing it would've been for Kora to die and someone else to pick up her mantle as group leader and try to find the lost princess as a way of honoring Kora??? The whole point of this big of an open world is for each character to have their own story. We got a bit of that as each main character sort of formed bonds with someone else (ex. Nemesis and the blonde kid, Tarak and Milius) but when you make it so painfully obvious that the stakes are so low, those don't matter.

Honestly this entire movie fell flat and there are so many instances I was like WTF is this?? You need consistency across a movie. You cant have cool, epic battle sequences, explosions, and karate moves and then have the orbital canon dude take 18 hours to shoot the goddamn gun. Also when Noble got stabbed in the back by blonde boy, why in the hell did he not push Kora's head into it??? 😭😭😭😭😭 it was like an inch away????

Overall, super disappointed in this movie. This had so much potential but they decided to make it like star wars but somehow even screwed that up

The bad guys have the tech to scan the village and see inside the structures and see all the grain but can't seem to see the freshly dug underground tunnel network?

The dude has a clear style that can bang pretty hard and some of his visuals are actually pretty goated imo, just that the dude can’t write a coherent story to save his life. 

Pair snyder up with a team of decent screenwriters and executive producers to oversee him and occasionally go “no zach that would be stupid” and i’m certain he would make killer movies.

Like 300 and its sequel have some awesome shit in them and they know they’re le epic popcorn flicks and feels like they lean into it.

Suckerpunch is an objectively terrible movie but somehow i still love it because he put a big samurai with a minigun, and dragons, and orcs, and cyborg armies and all this other baller shit in the movie that makes watching it visually interesting enough to keep you in ( or at least me )

Part One of Rebel Moon made me think that the ""Part One"" bit of the title was an ironic play on the naming of Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope... At least, after watching it I hoped it was!

For context,  we have Rebel Moon Part One and Two on one end of the quality scale,  and then we have Dune Part One and Part Two. In terms of sci-fi entertainment,  this is like comparing tin to bars of beskar.

And yes,  one is an original IP and one is derived from one of the greatest sci-fi book series ever. However,  I'm not certain we should be giving Rebel Moon a pass simply because of that.

Truly awful movie full stop.

She says how she fought her way out but rly she just k8lled all the guards with little to no effort spinning round in circles killing them all, but yet she cant pull the trigger when she aims at balisaius at point blank range.

1c7qok0,Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver - Review Thread,l2f8ucg,2024-05-03 17:03:24,"Pretty bad. 

Rote generic action scenes, and *really* bad acting all around, especially from that Cleopatra Coleman ""actress"" - everyone in the cast was blatantly just reading their lines and phoning it in for that sweet paycheck. The only exception being Ed Skrein who was the only one who appeared to give a shit about not looking terrible on screen. 

The scale was surprisingly small for a relatively high budget film like this...some CGI airships and a few houses nestled against some mountains pales in comparison to what Star Wars does tremendously better, which is giving off a sense of grand scope and scale. Lastly, I have to say that the grayscale coloring characteristic of Zack Snyder films got old really fast. 

***Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver*** **(2024) film overall rating: 2/10, CGI was decent...that's about it on the positives. I highly doubt there's going to be a Part 3 even if the ending was heavy handedly alluding to a sequel.**",FinanceWeekend95

Infact, I'm still watching it, albeit, struggling my way through.

It is so bad, and I mean bad. Special effects and filmography are good, but so far, nothing happened, and now it's been just mindless violence for the past 20 minutes or so?

I have to admit, I've kind of forgotten what the point is. Are the villagers fighting, to their Deaths, to protect the grain, that they then let the enemy shoot at? What was their logic for fighting?

""Better to be dead, than to be making grain for the enemy?"" cool story, but haven't you got kids?

I just don't understand what the actual 'plot' is for most of this. It's just, disjointed, and makes fuck all sense. I'm supposed to care about these characters? I barely remember any of them, they're all much the same tragic type.

I totally get if this isn't your cup of tea, I get if you don't like slow mo (even tho stepping into a Snyder movie and being mad about slowmo is like purposely jumping into a pool and being mad that you're wet), and I get if you wanted more time with the characters as I did too...but it's pretty clear that many of the reviews for both of these movies are a bit unhinged. There's no way this movie is a THREE out of TEN or a TWO out of FIVE.

I mean you can go through a lot of criticisms and just pick them apart. They act like 60% of the runtime is slowmo when it's like less than 10% probably lol. Even Charlie had the same reaction to the film that he did for his esports team not being allowed in the US lol. ""At 13 minutes in there's a slow motion scene and then 3 minutes later there's another!"" It's like...okay...but how much runtime are we talking about? It seems like slow motion is automatically taboo if Snyder does it but the use of it is barely mentioned in films like Inception, Lord of the Rings or Dredd which is chalked full of it. What is so bad about utilizing speed ramping or extending the scene? We love still images...we love motion pictures, what exactly is so horrible about peppering in shots that sit in between the two? 

I just wish ppl could air their criticisms with some couth instead of acting unhinged and pretending this is the worst two films ever made. Even if you HATE it, you can maybe push a strong 5 out of 10. It seems to me that he made some real enemies in the lead up to his Justice League cut getting made and a lot of people in the Hollywood review business who think they have some type of ownership over the films industry are still upset it ever got made. They blame him for some of his more unhinged fans and they will never give him an ounce of charity because of it. The industry is worse off without film nerds like Zack Snyder. I personally love both films despite some of my issues with them. They're beautifully shot, have state of the art VFX, have incredible action and choreography and some amazing casting. The rewatches on them always get better to me when I can move past what my expectations were and enjoy the film. I think his actual cuts coming in the summer will be totally different in nearly every way, tho I don't expect any of his critics will allow themselves to be swayed.

I graded part 1 like a 5,5/6,0 because the slow motion scenes killed all the actions scenes he used it on and it was clear some of the story was cut (they just suddenly jump around and start recruiting people), in this part altought he used a bit too much slow motion it was a much fitting application and the story was more concise.

I also find it funny how everyone is acting like this style over substance approach was somehow unexpected. You've seen a Zack Snyder movie before, right? I'm not trying to excuse the negatives, and there are negatives. The dialogue is embarrassing, and the character development is either nonexistant or as basic as basic can be. But I'm not watching this movie for well fleshed our characters or for great dialogue. I'm watching it for the visuals, and the action, and on both of those fronts, this movie delivered for me. Snyder always makes a stunning movie, and this is no different (although I didn't like that weird technique that makes the background blurry the majority of the time, that was annoying). The first hour is slow, but even so, I enjoyed it because of how absurd it was, I mean, slow motion grain farming? It is so ridiculous that I began to have fun with it. But when the action starts this movie becomes nothing but action and it's great.

There has to be a certain amount of just general dislike for Snyder films that make people go into these already with a bad attitude, which then makes you pick out each and every bad thing that most movies do.

These are no worse that multiple crappy Marvel movies that everyone seems to enjoy.

The movie is 90% made out of tropes that have been recycled for the 1000th time, and that makes the story very predictable. After the first part i had hopes it would become more than just 7 samurai in space, but it was not.

It also has some serious rhythm issues (maybe because it was shot as a different, long r-rated movie but about 50% was cut to make it netflix friendly?).

I was laughing out loud at the scene when they’re all just sitting around trauma dumping their backstories, when they were unironically on their like 5th different flashback. But damn the Snyder stylization of action and fight scenes is really damn fun to watch, and I thought the effects were really nice. I like the sci-fi aesthetic it’s going for, I like how the laser projectiles still feel really weighty and not just nothing lasers. I also kinda like how outside the clumsy opening narration there’s not a lot explained to the audience. They just do things and have tech and don’t explain them, they just are and we see how they work. Or we don’t and it doesn’t really matter. To me these are just dumb generic sci-fi fantasy action movies but with really good effects and fight scenes, and that’s enjoyable in its own way.

There was an era when I looked at 300 and told myself dayummm that muscle body is fantastic, I gonna train like one of them.

Next era was the Marvel thirst trap on all the Chris, I got excited cause they brought super hero with godly muscle build to real life, and I told myself I'm going to train like them.

This era Moon Rebel had me in awe over all the thirst traps, got me paused and staring at it, and told myself it's time to train again.

I'm a simple man, I watch movies turning off my mind and expected nothing. I love it.

The way they touch grass with nemesis for her grand stand, the robot kick ass scene, the villagers sacrifice to protect their people, the army feeling ridiculous of artherleas onboarding, the damsel in distress, and the visual is just beautifully brought to life.

I watched on my 55' TV and I felt that if this gets premier on theater instead, it be crazy.
It's not Dune level of techy, but the army formations felt good. Both these film makes me feel like we are 1 step closer to a Warhammer 40k epic movie/tv series.

1c7qok0,Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver - Review Thread,l0d2lpt,2024-04-19 22:04:18,"I finally understand what the problem with Snyder really is. 

Looks like he is so influenced by Howard Roark, the titular character of Fountainhead that he stupidly sees all these theatrical cuts of his film as ANTI-creative freedom/anti-art or something rather than understanding what the nature of the job itself is & what it asks : **efficient storytelling**.

> The problems with his theatrical cuts is akin to the step-fatherly treatment of a particular niche of storytelling with disdain, which I do not think any filmmaker worth his salt should have, tbf it honestly reflects in one department of the end-product the most : **EDITING**.

His theatrical cuts are horribly edited that take out most of the meat of personal narrative beats in storytelling & the end product we're left with is silly, derivative & at times, visually unique stock action - with his worst over-indulgences.

He doesn't get that first impressions matter & I can't see why anyone should be interested in watching a longer version of the same product if condensed showing is so inferior.

On the contrary, condensed films like Dune were narratively/visually/editing so interesting & compelling that it makes people ask for more.

I've been a fan in the past, but until he starts delivering on that (i.e. superior theatrical cuts), I think his career is done or he shouldn't be allowed to fail upwards anymore.

The guy needs to make more indie films first to get his narrative sensibilities in order than have another go at blowing up 160-200M in budget, like many other inferior filmmakers in the industry get as well. Or transition to producing. Or make films out of his own pocket.

That money can seriously go to so many deserved people who haven't had their shot of storytelling yet.

He also doesn't get that a vote against his films is NOT an affirmation/approval to films made by committee, just an appeal that he should invest more in the weaker parts of his storytelling first : Editing, compelling actors, score...even cinematography as of recently. 

And to his credit, his extended cut of Justice League had good pacing for a story with extended length. But then, again - most of the times, his theatrical cuts are fumbles of the highest degree..and this one isn't any better.

Very disappointed, even as a fan of some of his previous work.",gwynbleidd2511

He had the virtually unlimited creative freedom, budget, entire franchise, his own studio, and two two-hour feature films to take on such a basic, unambitious, utterly unoriginal vision, and the results somehow manage to have terrible action scenes, unremarkable set pieces, inconsistent characterizations, ugly visuals, pacing problems, worldbuilding that makes no sense, and a waterfall of expositions.

It's one thing for an auteur to do something bold and unique with a high budget and failing, like Heaven's Gate (and that's still a film where you can feel the money and artistry).

The first half is every ritualized warrior-honoring ceremony you've ever seen in every other piece of media all jammed together. Feasts, speeches around a fire, bestowing representative totems to the warriors, etc.

And all throughout the movie, every single character (on all sides) may as well be chanting *""Honor in struggle, glory in death.""* under their breath.

Death is never mentioned without mentioning how kickass dying in battle is. The one (1) singular time a character expresses regret about possibly dying, the person next to them mentions they'd be dying together and they're immediately convinced that dying is cool!

Even 100% of the random villagers (including small children) are brainwashed into this mentality over their \*checks notes\* 2 days of military training.

Multiple stages of the villager's battle strategy involve concealed positions where people will pop out, catch a bunch of bad guys unaware, and then will 100% without a doubt die. Hopefully making a favorable trade with their lives. And they ARE planning to die. They loaded up their own positions with explosives that have to be detonated from INSIDE the position.

I couldn’t think of anything good, so I wrote about learning my ABCs. Despite the trite premise, I took it seriously and wrote about how literacy changed how I saw the world. 

My professor made us each come in to have the essay graded in person. As he read my first paragraph, he said it was funny. However, as he got to the reflection part, he drew a tombstone in the margin and told me my essay had died. He then chastised me saying, “Your jokes have to be funnier.”

I left a bit confused because I had written the essay seriously, but then realized he was right. A trite premise is absurd, and absurdity is funny. My problem was I didn’t realize I was joking, and so instead of leaning into it I let the joke die and my essay with it. 

I think Zack Snyder has the same problem. Slow motion wheat threshing by hand in a sci-fi movie is funny. A coal powered starship is funny. A robot flower child is funny.

They go to the cantina in tattooing, they meet Jan solo but scummier. He joins them almost immediately. Grain is discussed so much more. Then they collect a bunch of people that only have about 6 lines each. Then she confesses to her like skywalker sidekick she used to be part of the empire and is the adopted daughter of the emperor. Then they get betrayed by Han Solo and taken to the leader of the bad guys that were stealing the grain. She kills the leader and then they escape, meanwhile the bad guy gets revived by the emperor.

So why do studios prefer more expensive CGI that looks worse? Because the less ""real"" stuff in the movie, the easier it is to change the movie as much as they want in post after they run it through focus groups. Its way more expensive after the fact to restart shooting on physical sets and such, but if 90% of the movie is digital they can pay VFX people to basically remake the movie.

Very few stories are truly original, most borrow key concepts from earlier work, which borrowed from earlier material, and so on.

Rebel Moon looks good. The visuals are spectacular. But especially in this day and age special effects can't carry a film. I don't think I've watched anything as long as the two parts of this film and yet cared so little about any of the characters.

Fortunately, once they got past the sentimental stuff - which seemed artificial since none of these people really developed a bond in Part 1- we were treated to more than an hour of nonstop crash, smash, boom. If you go in not expecting more than that, I suppose it's entertaining enough. 

Oh, and is is not incredibly obvious that the girl the rogue private has kind of a crush on is the Princess? Anthony Hopkins bot just about comes out and says it.

The Dawn Of The Dead remake was excellent and one of the better horror remakes I've ever seen, 300 was a hit and Watchmen for me personally is a classic. And this is where I think a pattern emerged, as long as he only directs and someone else takes care of the writing (in Watchmens case basically Alan Moore for the most part) the film usually turns out OK. 

I enjoyed Sucker Punch and Man Of Steel on the sense that while neither of them were what I would describe as great they were entertaining on their own merits. Everything since then however has basically been a complete misfire. Since the internet went alight with demand for the Snyder Cut of Justice League I think his ego has inflated to cathedral like proportions and made him believe that he's not only a God tier director but that people also want 4 hour long cuts of all of his films.

While I didn't like Sucker Punch, I could give you *why* I enjoyed 300, The Watchman, Man of Steel, Justice League, and even BvS (to *some* extent.)  Whereas most people either fail to get what he is going for with all the slow motion and stuff, or they *do* get it and don't like it, I really appreciate the dramatic compositions he puts together in frame.  There's always a sense of over-the-top bombast in his work, to me it reminds me of the paintings of Cole, Delacroix, or Gericault.  It lacks the thematic impact of these artists but I enjoy the attempt to put this kind of compositional drama on screen.

Because those characters were talking as friends. They were having a heart to heart. They were talking about their problems and the burdens they were shouldering.

They were on vacation together and were getting close with each other after spending the episode and several other episodes before talking and laughing like people.

Rebel Moon gives us absolutely no character dynamics to speak of. They don't talk to each other like people, and they have never had a single human moment together. They don't help each other out in times of need, yet they also don't get into petty squabbles.

They just list down their tragic backstories and expect me to care about them. Listen, Zach. We are not reading your character sheets or even want them dramatically read to us with gravely voices.",Karkava

Don't know if it's him or his editors, but they kinda did a horrible job on the theatrical or principal cuts of his last few films. It reflects in cinematography as well, at times in music too with Netflix ones.

Writing department as well if we're being honest post DC, and even few of those didn't 100% stick the landing (and I kinda have liked his filmography for the most part, even with its flaws).

Netflix tenure has been nothing but a bunch of straight up mediocre films, and don't really want his DC tenure to be the hill where he peaked at best because there was so much on the table to offer.

With right partners, his films should ideally be straight up if there's adequate restraint & everyone excelling at what they do. 

Could be the breakout launchpad project for so many writers, actors, cinematographers, casting directors, editors, composers trying to break in.

He needs to do what Blomkamp and Del Toro did, go back to getting very reduced filming budgets, and direct a couple of those to earn his way back to a $200 million budget. Nolan did Oppenheimer for half that budget and was very successful against a blockbuster competitive release.

1c7qok0,Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver - Review Thread,l0an3jt,2024-04-19 13:27:20,"> The Dawn Of The Dead remake was excellent and one of the better horror remakes I've ever seen, 300 was a hit and Watchmen for me personally is a classic.

Dawn of the Dead is barely recognizable as a Snyder movie, and, for the latter two, he practically used the comic books as storyboards. I guess if you want a 1:1 translation from comics to screen, he's your guy, but the more creative he gets, the worse the movie turns out. The Snyderisms he added to Watchmen screwed up the themes, if not the story.

It also doesn't help that it seems like he's fully bought into the ""visionary director"" label he was given in the Watchmen marketing campaign. I usually hate when people call a film pretentious, because it often means the director is trying something a little deeper, but most of Snyder's post-Watchmen films are the definition of pretentious. They're shot like they're the most serious, important films ever made, but they have nothing going on beyond the surface (and reviews indicate the sequel actively shies away from saying anything at all.) Rebel Moon is a big, dumb, macho action flick, so why is he so afraid of making it fun?",TheDeadlySinner

Sure, Sucker Punch is divisive and I just couldn't see past the shallow video game aesthetic of it all but he did Man of Steel which was  quite solid (the finale is definitely a choice but he put it out there even if he pissed off some purist fans).


The last few years since he's moved on from the DCEU, (The Snyder Cut is pure indulgence) I just can't get onboard his train. His Netflix films have just been unwatchable and his storytelling has I feel, just stagnated. He harps on about how his films deconstruct the genre and tropes, so either get onboard with that or you ain't my fan is not a particular tone I appreciate. Rebel Moon I just couldn't give a shit tbh. 

Still. Like Michael Bay I hope he goes back to basics and just do something simple and small, flex his storytelling chops in a different way and dial down on the slo-mo. I think Zach is a good guy, so I hope he can produce another banger of a film I can get excited about.

3) Snyder brings his movies in on time and either on or under budget. It can’t be overstated how being reliable in this arena will make you very appealing for future jobs in the movie business. 

4) He had some big hits early in his career that Hollywood still gives him clout for, though they probably shouldn’t. This is something Hollywood’s always had a problem with, see Ridley Scott’s career for how it happens with one guy decade after decade (to be clear Scott is definitely a better filmmaker than Snyder, but dude has a bunch of under-performers or outright flops on his resume). In the ‘80s, he got jobs because of the success of Alien. He bounced back in the early ‘90s with Thelma & Louise, weathering a series of bombs with that film’s surprise hit status until Gladiator in 2000. Gladiator carried him to The Martian in 2015, and he’s now trying to find that next hit that will get him through the 2020s. Snyder’s biggest fuck up is not producing an easy crowd-pleaser in the last ten years. I will be very surprised if Netflix sticks with him for another project, this could be what gets him in director’s jail after almost fifteen years of disappointments.",NeoNoireWerewolf

Sucker Punch could have been fun camp, but instead it was a garbage movie about I guess sexual assault? And then that push for the Snyder Cut was framed like we were getting our chance to see Citizen Cane in the way Orson Welles always intended. The whole thing's ridiculous. His movies are never remotely fun even though he's often tackling silly subject matter.

The problem is you cannot make a dumb heist film, just as you cannot make a dumb whodunit. It is one of the hardest genres to write for a reason.

The key to heist stories, the core of the genre that makes the heist stories fun, is clever problem-solving. We want the team to work intricately together where everyone has their special role in the intricate, elaborate plan. 

If Snyder wants to make a film where a bunch of shit happening just because with no rhyme and logic, he should have made something like Zombieland. But he also wanted to make an Oceans 11 with zombies, and that is not what Snyder's talent lies.",onex7805

He understands how to make a film look good.  He understands iconography and how to make action heroes look heroic.  But he just doesn’t understand subtext.  Everything is so literal.  So Watchmen is visually the most comic-accurate adaptation ever and  I really enjoy it for that.  But it’s also kind of misses the point of Watchmen.   
  
I felt similarly about Man of Steel.  Was really enjoying it up to the third act.  The building starts falling and the 9/11 allusion seems clear.   In my mind I’m like “Oh, Superman’s gonna stop the building from falling and save everyone.”  But nope, Superman and Zod fight through the city, likely killing thousands of people.  Superman doesn’t lead him into space or over the ocean to save anyone.  Because destruction looks cool.

Once they learn she is in the ship with them, they try to bomb the village.


The reason why they though the army were so desperate for food for soldiers they would hesitate shooting them was because they didn't know that officer was still alive, and believed that the empire ordering a battle ship was a sign of desperation rather than trying to catch the protagonist. ",Academic_Paramedic72

A heist plot is about overcoming **unique obstacles**
 with **clever solutions** to move closer to the goal. 

Zombies are, by definition, a dumb, thoughtless brute force numbers foe. They cannot react, be dynamic, have any motivation, or do anything unexpected.


There is a massive incompatibility here as a concept. It's just more dumb juvenile thinking from Snyder thinking it's innovative to combine genres. But instead a specific vision or ideas making it worth doing, he just picked two genres out of a hat.


Now, could a very talented writer and director make the premise work? Obviously yes. A good writer can make almost anything work, but that's the quality of the writer not the premise. The premise of Army of the Dead is not some great premise filled with potential that Synder fumbled.

I think the story and execution does enough to set itself apart from the multiple sources of inspiration.

Most of them were exactly that type.

A huge part of the reason Snyder fan base is so rabid is that he shoves libertarian garbage into every project he makes whether it makes sense or not. That's why his Superman is the way it is. That's why the ending to Watchmen was changed. Randian romanticism is Why Snyder's characters tend to be less like characters and more like ideals. It's the Howard Roark / John Galt type things rather than be a character with shades of gray and different emotions Snyder has them become a mouthpiece for a value. Howard Roark is not a character he's individualistic capitalist personified. In Watchmen the collectivist nihilism of the comic gets Zach's twist. Rorschach was original a critique of Randian objectivism but Snyder inverts it so that he's more a tragic hero rather than the total loser Moore wrote him to be.

Kurosawa's samurai were _samurai_, that is, a higher class in a society with strict class culture. They are contrasted against the lower class, peasant farmers, for the entire film. The struggle in the first act was finding samurai to fight for the lower class for practically no pay and no chance of glory because fighting bandits isn't exciting or important. The seven samurai aren't fighting for themselves at all. The samurai were the main power structure of their society at the time.

In Rogue One, they are all rebels fighting enemies significantly higher on the power structure. They are all fighting for their own reasons.

This fits the revenge heist genre more. Similar to the Italian Job, everyone in R1 is there for personal reasons. Much of the runtime of the film is spent setting up the heist/forming a crew.

>Honestly it was kinda cool from an industry point of view too because this had never happened before, a movie was basically being remade by its original director just some years later

Except it did happen before.

Paul Schrader was fired after completing filming for a prequel film of The Exorcist franchise, Renny Harlin was hired for 12 weeks of reshoots and Exorcist: The Beginning was released in 2004. After Beginning failed at the Box Office, Schrader was given a chance to complete his version of the film that was released as Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist in 2005.",rov124

It's got some decent ideas and has a brutal tone that really hits the mark for how a teen could become a mass shooter. I was basically tricked into watching it and completely surprised that it came from Boll since it wasn't a video game movie or felt like a tax exploit like his other films. And then he made sequels that turned the psychotic mass shooter from a tragic villain into an antihero for some reason. First film he's killing people because he believes in 4chan Nazi ideas. Later films he's killing the president of the United States for being corrupt and global warming or something.,Darthtypo92

1c7qok0,Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver - Review Thread,l0b4hz3,2024-04-19 15:12:38,"I think my biggest gripe with the Snyder Cut is that there doesn’t really seem to be a story there at all, just MacGuffins and lifeless characters to chase them. Much of the plot revolves around the resurrection of Superman, but it feels without any weight, because the previous movies haven’t really given us any reason to care about him as a character, and most certainly no reason to care about the other characters that we’ve only barely seen. There’s no moments for the characters to get to actually know each other, like the scenes in the first Avengers movie. No time to breathe and let the audience care about the characters and see what makes them similar to us. In that sense the comparison to LotR and Dune seems wild to me. Both of those franchises are primarily about the characters and why we should care about them. There are bigger things going on, but they only exist to colour the canvas, not to be the main function and reason for the film. The motherboxes are no different than the Sith Wayfinder in how unengaging they are. 

Sadly I haven’t really enjoyed any movie after Endgame apart from GotG 3, but Eternals seems like it at least had an idea of what it wanted to do, even if the execution failed, in my opinion.",SiriusMoonstar

13n4s9k,Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Review Thread,k5ncopj,2023-10-20 04:33:16,"I know I’m going to be in the extreme minority here, but I’m really of the opinion that the film is a bloated mess. There are very few positives that I can glean from it. They took a film about the sheer brutality of a man partaking in the murder of his wife’s entire family and somehow used the final act of the film to attempt to carve a sympathetic figure of DiCaprio’s character and focus on the “love” that he had for his wife. You know, the wife who’s family he played a large, fully knowledgeable part in eradicating.

The performances put forward were, for me, painfully uninteresting with the exception of Lily Gladstone. She did as well as she could have with what she was given, but for some reason was relegated to the sidelines for the final hour of the film. And the brief moments she is seen in the final act show her seemingly indifferent to the realization that her husband has taken part in the slaying of her entire family.

DiCaprio has been horribly miscast here. The hammed up accents used by the radio actors at the end of the film were meant to be caricatures, but really don’t sound all that dissimilar from the schlocky ones used by DiCaprio and De Niro throughout the film. To tell this story in an impactful way it needed a director with the courage to make the Osage characters the focal point of the film and to examine the destruction of Mollie’s family, and the destruction of the Osage community at large, even if it meant making a relative unknown in Gladstone crux of the picture. But of course that means Scorsese wouldn’t have been able to shoehorn his two favourite leading men into nearly every moment of the film. What we’re left with is a film about con men and murderers attempting to get away with a big score when the opportunity was right there to make it so much more meaningful.

I don’t want to come off as a Scorsese hater. He’s clearly one of the all time greats and a personal favourite of mine. But I just can’t get past the fact that he has taken a tragic historical tale with a massive amount of emotional heft and turned it into a predictable procedural that has just been totally stripped of emotion. The script only allowed the character of Mollie to show any semblance of emotion in the immediate aftermath of each one of her family members deaths, and then essentially thrusts this bizarre ambivalence upon her once the reality of what her husband has done comes to light.

I wanted to like it. I really did. But what I found was an interminable slog that highlighted the least interesting characters and performances for the entirety of the film. A real miss from Scorsese IMO.",faffleeee

13n4s9k,Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Review Thread,k5ui3yw,2023-10-21 16:09:42,"Since most of the reviews here so far are negative, I’ll be the dissenting opinion and say that I really, really enjoyed this movie and disagree with a lot of these complaints. The movie *is* long, but I never found it to be boring. I was engaged pretty much from start to finish. And I don’t really think there’s anything I would have cut out. Every scene tells us something. 

And I’m quite glad the focus of the movie wasn’t on the FBI investigation. We have plenty of investigation procedural movies…this was something more unique. Also, I think the fact that the FBI doesn’t come in until almost a third of the way through the movie is kind of the point. It took so long for the government to care about the Osage people, for the government to do anything about it. Having the story start with FBI involvement would almost feel like a lie. Because they weren’t there until it was much too late. 

I do wish the story had centered more on the Osage characters, not just Mollie, but other Osage people as well. But I think the decision to follow Leo’s character does offer a lot of interesting avenues to explore thematically. His character isn’t just killing people, he’s killing his own community, his own family…people that welcomed him in when he arrives to their land as a stranger. All for his own greed and aided by self-deluded justifications. There’s a bigger implication being made here. 

>!Ernest and Mollie’s relationship towards the end did bother me a little. But I don’t think she was ambivalent towards her husband’s actions. She was sad and tired and had no family left except for Ernest. I think she wanted to believe him when he said he didn’t do it and then after his testimony she wanted to believe that he at least loved her. And I think Ernest also wanted to believe that he loved her for his own conscience’s sake. But their last conversation hits a final nail into the coffin and I think even Ernest realizes he can’t believe his own words. He’s always been the wolf.!<

And I just can’t understand the commenters saying the felt nothing emotionally from this film…I was on the verge of tears for pretty much the whole movie and actually cried like two or three times (tbf tho I cry at almost every movie, even romcoms lol). Also, it’s very clear that Scorsese cared a lot about telling this story, from his cameo at the end and by the fact that he seemed to out so much care into consulting with the actual Osage tribe.",_unrealcity_

The shift, as per DiCaprio's insistence, from having the film follow the FBI agent to following Molly's husband was a poor change. DiCaprio was too old to play the husband and the character had a limited range of acting options. Leonardo spent most of the film channeling his inner De Niro by grimacing and that was annoying.

Instead, the film should have stuck to the original script and switched DiCaprio with Plemons. It'd have been awesome to watch everything unfold as the (F)BI Agent uses new-fangled techniques to get to the solution of the murders.

And it would have made far more sense for the FBI Agent to call Molly's husband ""Son"" because DiCaprio is 14 years older than Plemons and looks it. Seeing it happen the reverse in the film was off and by the umpteenth time awful.

Instead it was over 3 hours of Leo grimacing and trying to look young and dumb while important things happened that one could easy miss if you hadn't read the book. Too many filming style changes (the fire scene - WTF?!?, the ending).

Sorry Scorcese. This was a good film that could have been great if maybe you hadn't given in to DiCaprio.",hoppyfrog

The set pieces and costumes were brilliant, but the authenticity of the Osage actors unfortunately meant being taken out of it by non actors. An example of both issues was the scene with Henry attacking the store clerk. The choreography of the fight wasn’t dissimilar to Jake beating up the grocer in The Irishman, an infamously unrealistic and silly scene. Also, I don’t see the point of these scenes that last twice, sometimes three times the length necessary, they just drag on forever. Are they meant to be funny? Speaking of funny, Brendan Fraser and Jack White were highlights and made me laugh, but were hardly in it, and didn’t show up until late in the movie.

An uncomfortable masterpiece. As delicate in its handling of atrocity as it is in its delivery of the brutality that premeditates. The 3 1/3 hour runtime will feel like nothing afterwards, as the last frame from the projectors spool reels through you. You’ll leave your seat, the one in which you shifted in as if it was blame. Reminding yourself that this was, 
is, 
Real. Unable to come to terms with it.

Heavy and wrenching. Bathed in oil and blood, an anti-baptismal. A story of people subjugated and siphoned, a final blow to the nail in the coffin of modernity ripping through them. Like a knock at the door, haunting our outcome.

The performances alone will make you feel like you owe more than the ticket. Lily Gladstone is a guiding light, telling you everything without saying a word. 

One of the best movies I’ve ever seen. A must see in the cinema. This movie necessitates the intimacy that ironically only exists when you feel claustrophobic in a theatre.

I like many others wish it was from Mollie’s perspective more but I appreciate Marty, based on Leo’s ask, changed the entire direction of the film and tried to make it more about the murders versus the forming of the FBI, and in that way I get the Native Americans/Mollie were centered more but it wasn’t as much as it should have been.

Didn’t feel the 3.5 hour running time at all with that exception of the extra long ranch-on-fire scene, eventually I was like “Okay okay we got it it’s on fire please let’s move on” lol.

I didn’t like the radio show ending but only because it robbed us of the scene we needed to see, of Mollie taking back her control and getting that divorce and keeping the money in the family.

I assume Marty was giving her that scene when she asked what he put in her insulin but I still needed to see her actually take back control, especially since she seemed so “calm” as Ernest talked over and over on the witness stand about how he legit murdered her entire family. 

A friend suggested De Niro killed the child Anna as a threat to Leo to keep him quiet but I didn’t get that at all. Am I dumb or was she onto something?

Also I appreciated the scenes where they were talking about folks right in front of them in their language, that cracked me up and I was like “Good!”

Also I appreciated they had Mollie be like “Of course he wants our money”, I love that they didn’t make her “dumb” and just thinking he really wanted only her love, no she was smart and realized what was going on and I appreciate Marty showing that.",MicaTheAwesome

And a twisted, tragic one at that.

\-Bilge Ebiri, Vulture

That's not the book's takeaway at all. The crimes were rampant and woven throughout the community due to the unique circumstances of being extremely wealthy and extremely vulnerable at the same time, with distant, unaccountable federal institutions as the only possible relief for injustice. I wonder if the quote is an accurate assessment of the film or a too-trite attempt to boil down its themes.

\*Not sure why the downvotes. The book made clear that many people were targeted throughout the community by many different opportunists, and that the crime the FBI brought to trial was only the tip of the iceberg. Within the context of the community at that time and the wave of mysterious deaths, there wasn't anything unique about the marriage at the center of the story except for the successful resolution of the criminal case. Calling it ""the story of a marriage"" implies that it was a more isolated event.",f_d

Leo De Caprio is boring, his character one-dimensional & because he's adopted Marlon's mumble-talk, he'll be call a great actor in the tradition of Brando, who is also a Johnny one note- Leo has neither depth nor range & were it not for having Scorcese's blessing, he'd be another also-ran.  Killer Moon is scrambled & garbled & no two characters in the history of the movies have had less chemistry than Leonardo & Lily- they're two ships passing in the night-   the characters have zero redeeming qualities, between the drunken, slutty Osage women & the sociopathic white men who victimize them.

13n4s9k,Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Review Thread,jkzrz6u,2023-05-21 04:58:03,"Osage history from an earlier comment 

We-Bra-Ha(Thankful in Osage) this story is about my family and my people. Every Osage I’ve talked to says this is one of the most authentic films ever made. Osage elders have given their blessing to the cast and crew


Edit from an earlier comment of mine 

And I’m from the Osage tribe which fought in every American war since the revolution, for America. We have a song on our drum from the 1770’s that says we will fight for American until the end of time. We were cool with the founding fathers before there was an America , in the battle in 1754 when Washington was a British commander and every one of his platoon was kill but him when native saved him. Those natives were Osage’s and literally my grandfathers because they said they seen Washington and thought he was a special dude. The called him The Eagle 🦅. In the civil war my grandfathers were confederate officers, other Osage’s grandfathers were union officers because we all just went and fought beside the generals wer had always rode with.We always stood with America

We are also one of the only tribes I know to actual purchase our reservation which gave us certain rights over our land and minerals. In 1880 oil was struck on our reservation. Early 1900’s my osage grandfathers helped write the “1906 act of Congress” retaining our mineral rights and enacting a trust that can only be undone by another act of congress.By the 1920’s the New York Times ran a headline of “Osage tribe richest people on Earth” which we were because we owned the riches oil field in America . Which then made us the most murdered people, so much so The Osage murders were the reason the FBI was created. While natives could still be termed ‘indegent’ and a white man would be put in charge of the money. When the white guys figured out they could marry an Osage woman, kill her family, kill her and become lifetime aire of those oil headrights . Martin Scorsese is directing a movie with Leo DiCaprio shoot now based on the book “Killers of the flowermoon: The Osage Murders and the Creation of the FBI” about the Osage murders right now. I’m apart of one of those families. 

So much one of those families that , One family’s hired man strapped dynamite under their table and blew the family up at dinner, they had a young daughter who’s head was blown off and kept by the FBI until 2011 when they gave it back. I was actually the person that held her head in a box for the ceremony where the family had us help them put her head back with her body 90 years later. When it was done I looked at the head stone which had her Osage name on it, the Osage girls and my daughters Osage name were the same name.

Last thing , WAKANDA is not just a beautiful fictional land but the Osage word for “the Creator or God” since the beginning of time. Co creator of the marvel universe hack Kirby found the word studying ancient religion in college

It was January 20th, 2017, the same day that Trump was inaugurated as President. That’s same morning a dog killed a cat in my backyard. I don’t think premonitions come any more blunt than that. Then the screening of the movie I went to started at about 10 pm so i left the theater at nearly 1 am that night, exhausted. 

It was a movie that I had been looking forward to for many years. I had followed it development online for almost a decade. It was such a strange culmination, carrying all these emotions into it. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve really untangled the ways that I feel about even after all these years.

13n4s9k,Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Review Thread,jkzgml8,2023-05-21 03:08:11,"I will never like Silence because I know too much about actual world history of that time period. It presents the priests as innocent babes shocked by Japanese cruelty but actually there was as much casual cruelty and torture in Europe at that time - and a fair share of it at the hands of the Catholic Church - where imprisoning people in small pages and ramming spikes up people's asses was pretty common.

Ironically  the problems is the source material was written by a Japanese writer trying to make his Japanese audience feel shame for the cruelty of Japanese society at the time (post WWII self-criticism is common in Japanese fiction). The novelist may have thought he understood the intents of Jesuits in japan but don't think he understood the society they came from at all, and that probably was not his ultimate point anyway.

But Scorcese's film is not intended for the same kind of audience as the book, therefore I find it extremely obnoxious how the film is so one-sided against the Japanese (who actually had a pretty good reason for getting fed up with Christians for reasons I won't bore anyone with).",ooouroboros

You get all the shitty verbal tics people use to walk around they know what they're saying isn't complementary:

> Many franchise films are made by people of considerable talent and artistry. You can see it on the screen.

Oh yeah guys, don't get me wrong, they're totally skilled people! And then, as with all of these comes the one word that undercuts all of it:

> **But** I grew up when I did and I developed a sense of movies — of what they were and what they could be — that was as far from the Marvel universe as we on Earth are from Alpha Centauri.

My favorite part is the next one, where he just keeps digging that hole, completely and blissfully unaware how two-faced he's being in the moment.

> For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation — aesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation.

Yeah, that's right. Those Marvel writers, directors, etc are all people of ""talent and artistry"" and you can see it on screen. But I just don't have love or respect anyone who doesn't make the kinds of movies that existed when little Scorsese was watching them mid-Hayes Code and pre-Civil Rights Act.

You know what's also interesting, the guy refuses to discuss box office when it comes to this topic. I mean let's take a look at the recent efforts by the people he specifically names:

PTA - 47.8 million with Phantom Thread

Ari Aster - 48.1 million with Midsommar

Claire Denis - 2.8 million with High Life

Spike Lee - 93.4 million with BlacKkKlansman

Kathryn Bigelow - A 26 million dollar flop with Detroit

Wes Anderson - 64.2 million with Isle of Dogs

Interesting. What's the box office of the six worst marvel movies I wonder, just to compare?

The Incredible Hulk - 134.8m

Eternals - 164.8m

Captain America: The First Avenger - 176.7m

Ant-Man - 180.2m

Thor - 181m

Black Widow - 183.6m

So that's a total of 282.3m over 6 films, an average of about 47.1m each for the arthouse Scorsese Approved™ crowd versus... 1 billion dollars for the others for an average of 107.2m each. Just a scant 3.6x multiplier.

How is this relevant?

> So, you might ask, what’s my problem? Why not just let superhero films and other franchise films be? The reason is simple. **In many places around this country and around the world, franchise films are now your primary choice if you want to see something on the big screen**. It’s a perilous time in film exhibition, and there are fewer independent theaters than ever. The equation has flipped and streaming has become the primary delivery system. Still, I don’t know a single filmmaker who doesn’t want to design films for the big screen, to be projected before audiences in theaters.

> That includes me, and I’m speaking as someone who just completed a picture for Netflix. It, and it alone, allowed us to make “The Irishman” the way we needed to, and for that I’ll always be thankful. We have a theatrical window, which is great. Would I like the picture to play on more big screens for longer periods of time? Of course I would. **But no matter whom you make your movie with, the fact is that the screens in most multiplexes are crowded with franchise pictures.**

Oh, Boomer movie guy doesn't like it that the business he operates in is interested in putting the movies that literally. make. money. on the big screens.

But oh no he can't stop there, he's got to dig deeper:

> If people are given only one kind of thing and endlessly sold only one kind of thing, of course they’re going to want more of that one kind of thing.

That's right, the masses are being MIND CONTROLLED or SUBTLELY MANIPULATED into only wanting to see Marvel films. It's not a bunch of adults of reasonable intelligence and capable of making their own choices as to what they like and what the best use of their money would be. It's all a big conspiracy to make you like only marvel movies!

Christ, it's fucking embarrassing that someone would even make this argument, let alone try and defend it. There's nothing more moronically cringe than gatekeeping, especially to the obvious and complete detriment of something you like. There's more to the industry than pandering to dual income middle class white families with surround sound systems and large 4K tvs using subscription services.",Parenthisaurolophus

I feel like Leo couldn't be Lincoln but to be fair, part of that is because he doesn't look the part at all.  It would have been distracting.  But he's great at creating a character and imbuing it with charisma and subtlety and getting you invested.

Leo invented Jack Dawson from scratch, basically.  That was a pretty basic character, a Manic Pixie Dream Boy, the type that all of the young female (and some male) viewers were supposed to fall in love with.  He managed to make Jack believable, elevated him from what could have been a sappy trope.  DDL couldn't have done that role.  As wide as his range is, I'm not sure it includes that.

While I still admire actors like Cagney and Bogart, their range was somewhat limited by the era they worked in. They excelled in specific roles and genres, such as tough guys and brooding characters in film noir. However, when discussing the greatest actors, it's crucial to consider the evolution of the craft. Today, actors effortlessly transition between genres, time periods, and cultural backgrounds, showcasing immense versatility. Cagney and Bogart were iconic figures who made lasting contributions to cinema, but it's important to acknowledge the multitude of talented actors in subsequent generations who have pushed the boundaries of their craft.",Irarelylookback

That’s not necessarily a bad thing though, I think it’s nearly impossible for any actor at the level of fame to disappear into a character completely. 

Part of the reason why DDL or someone like Gary Oldman is able to do that more successfully is because they are far less famous than Leo is (or Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, etc.)

I’m a big Leo fan and he’s definitely a very good actor. I personally just find it hard to not see Leo when I see him in a movie. But he picks great roles and makes great movies so I don’t really care about that when I’m watching them.",None

I disagree with you that PSH and DDL were part of different *acting* generations, though. Even if they’re technically part of different cultural generations, 10 years isn’t that big of a difference career and experience-wise. 

I’d say that Hollywood generations come in 20s. Daniel-Day Lewis only had a small role as a teenager in 1971, so he didn’t come of age career-wise until 1982 with Gandhi. So DDL and PSH both really started their careers in the ‘80s and ‘90s, which I would consider the same generation of Hollywood.

In my opinion, the generation before *that* would be actors that started their careers in the ‘60s and ‘70s like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Diane Keaton.

You think you have some sophisticated nuanced take on this, when actually you’re approaching a domestic situation you nothing about OTHER than what was presented in court with a “guilty till proven 100% innocent of any unsavory conduct in any moment of weakness” mentality.

Conversations change and cannot feasibly be replicated. Im just pointing out that it’s definitely a varying degree of factuality depending on the topic. You make an active effort to change as little as possible (or change small things for strategic effect) in movies such as KotFM. While other movies you might not make that same effort. 

I understand not wanting to see a movie of such historical importance if you knew the filmmaker was not making these efforts to tell the story with truth being the focus. While other movies I don’t mind the filmmaker making changes for the sake of making art.",None

Also there was a lot of suppressed evidence that was allowed in the UK trial that never made it to light in the US one. Its okay, you can breathe, youre allowed to still like Depp (as a person or an actor) and reconcile with the fact he might have gotten in physical entanglements with his narrcistic ex wife. He might have even started a couple of the fights, we’ll never know for sure beyond their testimony, and I’m comfortable with that level of greyness and murkiness, since thats what life is supposed to be like when your not a celebrity and constantly being reported on. Its not my business at this point and their story at the bottom level isnt deep or interesting beyond a tabloid level. Marriages are complex, and both people can be shitty without the earth shattering. I’d reckon a huge amount of people in this sub are single, and therefore come into this issue with a big swinging unnuanced take.",davidh2000

13n4s9k,Martin Scorsese's 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Review Thread,k7l6c00,2023-11-03 00:47:45,"I could say that KOTFM did a drastic change by making King an old man. In real life, he wasnt close to being an old man when he was around 50 when he was sentenced in prison. In my opinion, the director did this to fit one of his motives the explotation of the young by the old (Goodfellas, The Departed). That change, and also others to me makes the movie a fiction, and should always be treated like it and never should we expect it to be a tool, or a message, or a vehicle to deliver any message or be the weapon at all. This movie was inspiring, I got home and immediateIy started looking the real facts. So the movie resounded but not for being true to the exact events, but fur the sins and values that were shown.

I think the debacle of Hollywood, or its lost of prestige, started  with hyper naturalistic way. Just like the Naturalism in the 19th century thater, this modern style of movies will die and I sicerely believe in 200 years this era will be remebered as one of the darkest in cinema. As we sadly see how it has taken a 2nd seat an is not the main source of entertainment.

You might be the first person I’ve met that doesn’t think movies can send a message or be a tool for education. This movie was true to the events (left some stuff out but didn’t change the actualities). I believe the goal of making art is to create something powerful that moves people and truth can do that. I don’t think changing Hales age from 50 to 70 made that much of a difference. Also 50 is old enough to have the effect of old vs young that you mentioned.

Also with your train of thought no movie, even documentaries could be considered “non-fiction” because perception will always eclipse objective reality.",None

Also, I’m not going by any details of your personal life that you didnt downright say here. You said you watched hours of court proceedings and immediately came to Depps defense in a comment that simply said he’s fallen from grace (which is not even a biased comment against Depp, his career has faced some backlash regardless of if you think hes guilty). I just think its not that healthy to care about a celebrites failed marriage that you werent even there to witness (not everything got recorded, probably pivotal moments) especially given how ridgid and defensive you got to the OP",davidh2000
