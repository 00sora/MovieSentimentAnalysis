From the moment they escape from Beckett and Jack has Will locked in the brig. He fully expects Will to break out and knows exactly what he'll do next. Then when Will realises Jack wants to become the captain of the Dutchman (Jack makes fairly obvious hints at this, but he really doesn't even need to) connection is pretty much established. My favourite part is probably when they're meeting with Beckett and Davy Jones on the little patch of sand and Elisabeth notices Will and Jack are acting weird (\* but Barbossa doesn't \*) and proposes the switch.",spacestationkru

I recently rewatched all the POTC films and while I don't share the consensus of this thread about 3, I do appreciate it a lot more after watching 4&5. I'm still astounded by the drop in production values from pirates 3 to 4 despite 4 having a higher budget.

\*Edit\* ^(Alright, a quick anecdote about my first viewing experience with Pirates of the Caribbean 3 which I hope can be somewhat amusing:)

^(My Dad promised me that if I went to the cinema to see Pirates 3 I could see Spider-Man 3 at a later date. Now, a 6-year-old me could handle an almost three-hour film. What I couldn't handle was that I needed a piss real bad by the 2-hour mark and to my amazement, the third act just so happened to include a giant maelstrom which didn't help my bladder. Despite the courage I showed by not asking my Dad to take me to the toilet during the film I never did get to see Spider-Man 3 while it was in cinemas. A 6-year-old boy was lied to that day... Love you, Dad.)",Polaredditor

lkv3gs,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End has one of the best openings to a sequel.,gnndoh2,2021-02-16 14:31:06,"[Here is a link to that opening](https://youtu.be/lNRjt4rCymM).  I also love that the prisoners sing what the Pirate King and the First Brethren Court did to Tia Dalma (Calypso) and why, and then when the scene cuts to Elizabeth she finishes the song explaining what the Pirate King must do to save the prisoners, and how they have been summoned to form a new Brethren Court to release Calypso from her flesh prison.  The plot of the movie is told to the audience in the first 5 minutes, and yet gives nothing away.  It is a brilliant scene.

**Prisoner child**

The King and his men

and bound her in her bones

Now some have died      
and some are alive      
and others sail on sea    
with the keys to the cage    
and the Devil to pay

The bell has been raised    
from it's water grave    
Hear it's sepulchral tone?    
A call to all

and turn yourself toward home  

Yo ho, haul together      
Hoist the colors high

Jesus, I love that scene. But it gets a little dragged down because in the two Davy Jones movies there are way too muhc action scenes and not enough script to make two 3 hour movies.

[Mad Max: Fury Road](https://youtu.be/oy_LFGCUXRI) was, without a doubt in my mind, one of the best 4 (and a bit) minutes of opening cinema.

Holy HELL was it a cold day! Not to mention our clothing was designed for the Caribbean, making it even more challenging. Puddles were frozen and the heater in the extras tent was too weak and would occasionally spew freezing air as we were all huddled around it. Causing us to all suddenly scream and run away!

I remember my mom loving it way more than I did, so perhaps she saw something in it that I couldn’t as a teen. 

Seeing it now, though, through the lens of both, an adult, and someone who loves the entire trilogy, I’ve really come to love Elizabeth’s transformation to Pirate King, Will’s shaky decent to traitor in his quest to save his dad, and everything that was Barbossa and Jack. It was even amazing to see the entire saga (a sad one, though) of of James Norrington reach an end, with his honor intact. 

I’ve almost even reached the point of liking it more than 2, but personally I find both equal in my book. My mom’s favorite is still the first, and while I concede it was much darker in tone than the last two (3 was a bit of a return to that dark tone) I simply like it.

Besides, I really love the third movie and I'm willing to overlook the flaws. It had so many memorable and great moments! Many of them are still used as quotes and memes! Being in people's minds after so many years is truly an achievement. No matter what you think about the trilogy, it delivered a fully consistent story with its beginning, climax, and ending.

Do I wish the end had all Pirate Ships vs the entire EIC fleet? Yes ofcourse. But I really enjoy how the film is a constant tide of tiny betrayals and agreements. The film's story constantly seems to change with each scene.

-Jack goes from returning from the dead to making a deal with Beckett, then helps the Brethren Cove unite, and ends up a prisoner momentarily nonetheless, finally sacrificing his dream of eternal life at sea to save a friend. 
-Will plays his own odds with his focus being his father, but he fits in well.

-Elizabeth has the best arc of the film for me, losing her father, being mistaken for Calypso, becoming a pirate lord, and then finding some sort of happiness with Will.

-All the supporting characters are brilliant, Davy Jones is menacing but you still pity him, Barbosa is savage and raw, and he has some of the best lines in the film. Even Gibbs and the crew do justice to their role.

Not many people know that people joined the pirates to get away from the British Navel Fleet which was a living nightmare to be a part of...not that you had a choice because they had all kinds of insane ways to force people to join. The conditions they forced sailors into were practically crimes against humanity.

The modern day equivalent would be if Amazon just straight tortured you or caused the deaths of its workers in order to go to war with all the competition. If [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com) did something faster, they would literally work you, no matter the cost, to beat them. And you would be jailed or shot you if you tried to escape. So the workers band together and start looting Amazon warehouses for supplies needed to live and whatever else because FUCK Amazon.

Now just replace Jeff Bezos with the British monarchy and you pretty much have the same thing.

But the fact that those films are even watchable at all is a testament to how well they were directed and edited. And tbh I think people were a little too hard on them when they came out.

lkv3gs,Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End has one of the best openings to a sequel.,gnnakfp,2021-02-16 14:03:00,"I always thought that one of the main problems with PotC after 3 was the setting. Setting the original trilogy in the era of the death of piracy was great for dramatic effect, but after that particular story it erased most of the magic of the franchise.

Like, the reason why pirates + magic works so well is because it was a time period when the world was still not fully known, the oceans, islands, etc were not fully explored and registered, so you get the feeling of the unknown, that maybe there are still ancient secrets out there...but by movie 3 the world map is complete. Not only that, but pretty much every corner is ruled or controlled by someone (mainly the Indians Company, apparently). So you have these pirate adventures in a world that no longer has room for them, and inevitable story beats about trials, cities opening banks, etx. Too mundane. The world of pirates that was so appealing is gone, that world that was still kind of lawless and dangerous, but still magical.

I don't know if I'm making sense, but it would be like having an Indiana Jones movie set in the 70s: the world feels too real to have those magical, adventurous elements that work in the Nazi era, it simply doesn't work.

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so much.

It sets up the location and the setting beautifully, building the tension as you realise that the man we’ve been following is Bond, and not only that he’s after a target.

He finally reached the point for his attack. And then we cut. All that tension suddenly drops as we get normal ordinary cuts showing dialogue. The introspection of Bond on a hit goes. All the build up for absolutely nothing.

Long shots are a great technique when used well, but in Spectre it felt entirely masturbatory with no greater intention than “because we can”.

Compare with other long shot scenes and sequences like Children of Men, Birdman, and the funeral home episode of Haunting of Hill House where as a viewer you feel so trapped with these characters and so engrossed.

Heck the scene in Skyfall introducing Silva is a great example of a long shot. His dialogue as he slowly walks towards Bond, slightly out of focus most of the time so you can’t quite make him out until he is way too close. Beautiful.

I suppose as an opening scene reflective of the greater film an interesting premise with a disappointing payoff is appropriate.",Airules

Lord Cutler Beckett has his desk RIGHT NEXT TO THE GALLOWS. He's the most powerful person in the land, and we see in DMC that his office is quite opulent, but he FUCKING MOVED HIS DESK CLOSER TO THE HANGINGS.

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so.

We've been watching two movies about pirates and here's come the third to tell us ""Nope, the real world is coming.""

It unsettles you as the viewer because YOU have been sympathizing with pirates for the last 5 hours and what do you hear is a crime of piracy?

So now that means WE, the audience, can be hanged. You start asking yourself questions because now YOU are there. Then the kid sings and it sets a tingle because we know the bones of the song so when the ""Yo-ho"" hits we get sucked even farther back to the 1st movie. And once every single pirate starts doing it do you understand. No, no, no, no, this isn't a song. It's a call. A chant. Magic. You're drawn further in. After all, your life is in danger because of sympathizing, why not go that step farther. You need this song to work as much as them. You're starting... to *believe*.

But WAIT! Look there's the asshole from the last movie who made all this happen and hold on. He's not effected? This is fucking freaking you out as the audience member and it's not doing a thing to the villain. He should know the implications more, and we find he does.  With a single word.

2+3 focused on the East India Trading Company using the knowledge the pirates had known for years to rule the sea and eventually the world.

Which they knew, so they did killed as much as they could (alongside gathering the Brethren Court).   


4 focused on the aftermath of all this. If legends are real, could immortality be real. The fountain of youth be a thing.

WTF was that all about? There was subtly to Jack masked by Depp's over the top performance because he was written seriously. The writing of the other characters is crucial in allowing Jack to flourish. He got more screentime in 2 and 3 but the writing was still good enough for Depp to deliver genuine humour and elements of actual drama.

Pirates 5 is the only one to make me dislike Jack because his only joke is that he's drunk. The opening scene with him dragged on so much and that was the same for the rest of his performance.

He knew what could be done with CGI, and what would be best as a practical effect supplemented by CGI.

Look at Davy Jones. He's an entirely CGI character, and in a film 14 years old but he's flawless. The attention to detail is astounding.

The kraken attack on the merchant ship, that wasn't entirely CGI - they built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top. Then they just had to replace the tentacle.

I learned about the gig from a public casting call on Craigslist for ""pirate-y"" people who are skinny, amputated, missing eyes, lots of facial hair, tattooed, etc.

I took my own headshot and got really positive feedback since I was 6'4"" and 135 lbs. They scheduled a follow-up costume session, where a costume designer dressed me in tattered Caribbean clothes.

Day of the shoot, call time was 4-5am at Disney's nature ranch north of LA. It was still dark when we were shuttled onto a bus and driven to a literal tent city the size of a warehouse!

Dressing and making-up hundreds of extras was extremely well organized, efficient, and fun :) We had a ticket that connected us with our previously selected costume. Then entered a massive tent with rows and rows of make-up artists. I got scars and dirt painted on, but the worst part was having your teeth painted black.

After that, we were sent to a large holding tent for extras. In the middle was a massive cornucopia of catered foods like out of a fantasy movie! But no one cared yet because they were packed liked sardines around the only tiny hose pumping warm air into a tent that was 20-30 degrees F.

Once shooting started, they'd call for groups of us...20...30...etc. to come stand in a line for the gallows. We'd sometimes walk slowly or stand in background shots. It wasn't hard, just tedious to endure in skimpy clothes as frigid winds whipped through the set.

One of my fav memories was once the day warmed up and the sun came out, pirate extras went outside to throw a football around in their full costumes, which was a hilarious contrast watching them do something so modern!",slyweazal

Ergo, the world was not magic, only the gold was magic. It was not a fantasy movie, it was a pirate movie with a single fantasy element.

It's the Raiders of the Lost Ark formula. The presence of a magical ark does not make the world a fantasy world. The world is presented as just being the same world you and I live in, except with these one or two magical things in it.

This matters because the entire tone of the movie is informed by its setting. The nature of the setting changing between movies changes the whole experience.

I think honestly it would've worked better if they just kept it as a 'You can't do science you're a woman!' rather than trying to throw in the witchcraft because afaik what she did is sort of like an important part of sailing ships anyway?

Also I mean with the drunk Jack thing it was more the way they played it and tried to make it into one long drawn out 'lol jack is drunk' joke it made me cringe and it just wasn't that funny?

It's a bit like how I felt about Fat Thor in Avengers where I didn't necessarily think Thor kind of falling off the wagon was a bad idea it was more the way it was constantly being played for laughs of 'lol this character is fat' especially when contrasted to how the other characters had their trauma reactions portrayed in more realistic/sympathetic lights.",nocte_lupus

and it sounds like paying the actors and production crew cost a lot of money. roughly $400 million for that whole movie and Depp got $55.5 million, almost 8% of the budget was solely paying Depp, add in the rest of the co-stars and actors as well as production crew, that alone is a lot of the budget. 

Stranger tides also filmed in 3D which apparently isn’t cheap. “On Stranger Tides was filmed in 3D rather than using post-production conversion (except for one sequence). This increase filming cost considerably, while also complicate the shooting process. Especially in outdoor or underwater scene. Preparing and moving logistics across multiple premise also increase spending.”


some sources even claim the final production costs were $410.6 million, and that originally it had a budget of $300 million. and that this was after they tried to cut the budget down. i also read that they even moved primary production to cheaper locations (Hawaii and London, taxes aren’t as harsh there apparently)to save money. they also had to edit while filming, again to save time and money. this movie also ended up with less special effects and a shorter shooting schedule. they also received a $32.1 million rebate from the British government. 

“Even counting the $32.1 million rebate bringing the net total down to $378.5 million, it is still the most expensive move ever made, even after adjusting for inflation”

We've been watching two movies about pirates and here's come the third to tell us ""Nope, the real world is coming."" And it does by showing us that Cutler Beckett would happily kill a child, as long as that child is a pirate. It unsettles you as the viewer because YOU have been sympathizing with pirates for the last 5 hours and what do you hear is a crime of piracy?

>""Sympathizing with a pirate.

So now that means WE, the audience, can be hanged. You start asking yourself questions because now YOU are there. Then the kid sings and it sets a tingle because we know the bones of the song so when the ""Yo-ho"" hits we get sucked even farther back to the 1st movie. And once every single pirate starts doing it do you understand. No, no, no, no, this isn't a song. It's a call. A chant. Magic. You're drawn further in. After all, your life is in danger because of sympathizing, why not go that step farther. You need this song to work as much as them. You're starting... to *believe*.

But WAIT! Look there's the asshole from the last movie who made all this happen and hold on. He's not effected? This is fucking freaking you out as the audience member and it's not doing a thing to the villain. He should know the implications more, and we find he does.  With a single word.

Lord Beckett was a brilliant trader, schemer and political manipulator. In those situations, facing rational foes, he was essentially unbeatable. Because of this, he is used to being in control, and had even dismissed the magical/supernatural elements seen as something controllable (as long as you know how).  
  
In this situation, however, he had just recently lost control of the *Dutchman*. The enemies he is facing are behaving, from his perspective, irrationally and chaotically. They have completely upended his expectations, and he is suddenly faced with a *combat* decision in a moment where he has completely lost control.

We had some cheap nosebleed seats which actually turned out to be amazing with great views of the rivers and the city. PNC Park is our favorite stadium.  It was a perfect summer evening. 

It was a battle between the teams, the score was 1-1, until the 7th inning when the Reds scored a run.  You could feel a palpable let down through the stadium. We did not want to lose to the Reds in our own house especially after the big brawl. 

The Pirates brought in a pitcher called “The Nightmare”.  In about 9 pitches, he shut down the Reds with 100 mph heaters. You could feel hope starting to grow again in the stands. 

In between the 8th and 9th innings, they played the “Hoist the Colors” clip and the Buccs girls came running out into the stands waving these huge Pirates flags. We all started chanting “Hoist the colors” and “Let’s Go Buccs”.  It was an incredibly stirring moment.  

The Pirates pitcher did not give up any runs at the top of the 9th. Our hope was growing. Then when the Buccs got up to bat, they started getting some base hits. A single tied up the game. Then a perfectly executed sac bunt to advance everyone to 2nd and 3rd.  And then...

They hit a single to left field and they won!!!

And then there were fireworks. 

It was the best night of baseball ever.

“At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before.

Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!

Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!

Spears shall be shaken, shields be splintered,

A sword day, a red day, ere the sun rises!

Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightaway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.

Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly, the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be over taken.

Fey he seemed, or the battle fury of his fathers ran like new fire within his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a God of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shown like an image of the sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed.

For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath overtook them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.”",None

Now a couple years go bye, they want to make a new blockbuster with a director who’s previous biggest film was probably Chicago, and they started most of the production from scratch. I think that likely tied into the production troubles. The trilogy was among the biggest productions ever, and considering the technical achievement and the massive cast, it’s damn impressive they made it all for under a Billion.
  
Just my 2 cents on what you said. I’m a big fan of Verbinksi, what he achieved when given a movie ride for inspiration is quite incredible. And they still hold up incredibly well! One thing the trilogy does far better with than the later films, is blending the sets and characters with the CG. The art direction is incredibly consistent. Somehow with OST the sets and CG look very expensive, but not very good, and not well planned.",frockinbrock

“At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:


*Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden!
Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!
spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,
a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!*


With that he seized a great horn from Guthláf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.
Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!

Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. Éomer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first éored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Théoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as Oromë the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.”",DaLB53

The romance between the priest and the mermaid is cringe and extremely uninteresting. It develops without any meaning and out of the blue. Both of their characters are one-dimensional, lack any depths, and are deprived of any real developement in the movie. The whole thing makes me groan every time.   
   
BUT   
   
The movie has so many great moments, it redeems itself in my opinion. The whole London sequence of Jack’s escape is such a blast to watch. The Queen Anne’s Revenge is great and so is Blackbeard, the shenanigans on the island are fun, I still laugh at Jack and those palm trees...

Edit: Copy/paste from another comment where I solve the compass problem.

5 is my qualm-y one but that's only because of the compass. Really feel like they only added the captain giving Jack that compass to have the badass shot of him swinging it at Salazar. But this thread actually helped me solve my biggest problem with it.

So, Tia Dalma says she got Jack the compass but we learn in DMTNT that the captain of his 1st ship gave it to him. I contest that it is BOTH. 🤓

Jack got the compass from the captain, then lost it, as Jack is want to do. And I don't mean ""given away"", like it's implied breaks the curse, but he quite literally LOST it. Think about that. The compass points to what you want most and if Jack lost it, how would he ever be able to find it again? He lost his most important tool, his treasure finder, and couldn't ever find it again. So what's he to do? Go ask a swamp sorceress! That's where Tia Dalma comes in. SHE found Jack's compass again. No wonder he owes her so much. 

Therefore he never gave it away to break the curse and upend the 5th movie. He just lost it. Why? How? 

Cause he's Captain Jack Sparrow.",omegansmiles

But a lot of the rest of the plot stories (like Barbosa vs Blackbeard) were very well done and make up for it.  Honestly Geoffrey Rush steals every scene he's in (just like he does in 1 and 3).  The music, while not being Zimmer, is still very good.  Honestly opening scene in London with the king and re-introduction of Barbosa as a privateer is so entertaining, it does set the tone for the rest of the film as relatively fun, even if it's not as good as the first 3.

Two examples:
- in *At World’s End* they have an elaborate backstory between Jack, the East India Trading Company, and his refusal to trade people that resulted in his branding. Tell that story! Don’t leave it as subtext
- *Dead Men Tell No Tales* had Javier freakin Bardem as an awesome sea captain get outmaneuvered and an army crippled by Jack in a flashback! I would have been much more interested in that than the trident of destiny mcguffin thing.

Also, the main characters were great but the whole Pirates trilogy doesn't get enough credit for the writing of the minor characters like Gibbs, Pintel, Cotton, Swann, and the two British soldiers.

I personally think CoTBP would have been fine on its own no sequels but that's not the Disney way, success = sequel it seems. And they paid off imo. 

But I feel like most people's gripes from my experience are that it's not the cgi, the story, the new characters but Jack Sparrows character development.
In the first movie, he may be a bit flamboyant and like a loose cannon but he always has a plan and/or an ulterior motive. With the whole stealing the interceptor scene for example.
But in 2 and 3 he just becomes more and more ridiculous with things just sort of panning out good for him by chance, it's more luck than planning for example the tribe island in 2 and the God damn world's end crab boat thing in 3.

Bill Nighy’s performance as Davy Jones is stellar; the blend of his voice acting with the great visual effects make Davy Jones still one of my favorite villain representations in a long time. 

The stakes feel much higher in this movie and the character’s motivations really get dug into through the film. The themes of sacrifice running through Bootstrap and Jack and Davy Jones makes them feel like real characters with motivations rather than just pirates.

They weren't perfect, not even as good as the first film which was a fun adventure film at best, but they both had something that the latter sequels were sorely missing; ambition. You can tell that the writers and director were truly swinging for the fences and even if they missed more often than not, at least they tried. The 4th film in particular just felt lazy all around compared to those two.

Plus the last hour(ish) of At World's End, while over long, is something of a masterpiece in my mind. Elizabeth's speech, the maelstrom, the fights, the wedding in the middle of the fights, all with some epic Hans Zimmer music, and then the cherry on top of the destruction of Beckett's ship in slow motion. You can't get better than that.",joshi38

The director, Gore Verbinski, started off as a visual effects artists himself, so he really knew exactly what was possible and how best to shoot each effects scene to get the most out of his artists.

On top of that, a lot of the effects were practical, rather than pure CG. This made the films *insanely* expensive, but it's what makes them look so great. For example, the scene where the kraken breaks the merchant ship in half? They built a full-scale model ship, filled a pipe with concrete and dropped it on top.

The amount of planning, crossing, double crossing, making deals, breaking them, stealing, buying, hiding, finding, made it really interesting to follow and try and work out the best outcome for everyone.

That had it's charms but let's not let nostalgia distract us from the fact that the potholes where brutal. 

When they introduced Tia Dalma in Dead Man's Chest she makes comments about Davy Jones that don't make sense by any standard as if the writers at this point didn't know she would be revealed as Calypso. There is a point where a character isn't written as a good liar but appears in retrospect unaware of its own background. 

In fact everything todo with Calypso makes no sense. She has no impact on the story considering her insane power level. She throws a massive temper tantrum in form of a storm but that's it. It's not targetted and there is no further effect. She's not taking revenge she's just making a fancy swirly for the battle to have stakes. It also seems to have no long term effect on the universe that they fucking released a sea god that supposedly made the waters significantly harder to sail for pirates. Calypso isn't just chaotic evil, she's completely confused chaotic evil. She does things. Because she does them. Because she's the sea *it doesn't have to make sense* (were practically getting beaten over the head with the lampshading for lazy writing). 

And Davy Jones villain motive is that he's kinda got hit over the head too. The first part, sure, makes sense, where he gets supposedly betrayed by his godlover that he sold his soul to (!) so he gets a lot of pirates to work together and imprison her (nevermind for a second we're supposed to brush over the fact that he has no reason to know how to do that). But then, after half an eternity of being screwed over and screwing people over because he's still bound to the vow he made to her (and she crapped over hard) all she needs to do is say ""whelp, ya know, I kinda love you but I'll always be an abusive bitch, which you can't be mad about because you should have known"" for him to go ""yeah, makes sense. I love again, notice me senpai."" I've seen octopus solve complex puzzles, so if anyone wants to blame the tentacle brain for this degree of stupid, I'm calling bs.

Calypso was a plot device they did so badly.

EDIT: And i'm sparing you all a similar rant for the whole jack-will-liz triangle that only exists for pointless sexual tension and lovers quarrel. It's completely nonsensical even by teen drama standards and severely hurts the character consistency of Elizabeth.",Quantentheorie

It was a mostly normal and mortal world, and then had this one out of place fantasy element with the cursed pirates to give it a twist. In Curse of the Black Pearl the pirates were just pirates--normal people being debaucherous in Tortuga, in At World's End the pirates are part of a mystical society that can summon an ocean god with a semi-spiritualistic death hymn. If you look up ""jumping the shark,"" the first result should be this movie trilogy.

They were all debating releasing her because they *didn't* know what she was going to do. Some said that she would be grateful. Others said she was still their enemy. Essentially, no agreement was made.  
  
Then Barbossa said 'screw this' and trapped and planned to release Calypso anyway with the intention of ""I'll release her and she'll help me out"". That...*kind of* worked, just not as intended. They did release her but nothing really happened except she caused a storm for the final fight. Hence the 'what now?' from some of the pirates and some replied ""Nothing. It didn't work."" But then Elizabeth was like ""are you fucking kidding me? All this effort gone to waste? Nah bro we're gonna fight to the last breath""  which was *also* the point of the storm-for them to fight it out. And then they beat the dutchman and won the fight.  
  
It was intended to be a ""What now?"" scene. You don't need a goddess giving you buffs beforehand. All you need is a fighting spirit and a reason to fight and you damn well fight to the last breath!

The first movie is about a young naive boy joining up with a smuggler to stop an evil juggernaut with supernatural forces. Smuggler is obsessed with the fastest ship around. They take the ship to do things, implied the smuggler really only cares about money. Boy almost gets the girl (who is essentially a princess) throughout. References to a lineage. Rag tag group take on big evils and the ""empire.""

Second movie Who is my daddy? Meet my Daddy. Get his dagger thing. Also, let's go to a swamp to visit a wise old supernatural being who will tell us about destiny and fate. Boy loses girl to smuggler, smuggler dies...ish in a cliffhanger end...but everyone agrees to go rescue him in the next movie. We mix plots a bit here in that an old bargain by the smuggler is the core issue here, not as much the being chased by the Empire...but both are present. Old smuggling friends brought into the fold (whether Norrington is a Lando substitute is arguable). We also have a weird Ewok crossover here instead of the third movie. So it goes.

Uh oh, big angry Empire is back, let's go get a big coalition of previously unknown but similar anti-Empire folk. Also need to rescue the smuggler. On the way, let's resolve the princess and smuggler romance to get the love triangle out of the way. Big ship battle at the end which seemingly ends the Empire. Boy makes tragic sacrifice (gets the girl sorta...so that's a change), saves father from his supernatural eternal doom. Defeats the bigger grislier evil and becomes the sole weilder of the supernatural power.

Well, for the most part there are two novel series mostly aimed at young readers. The ""Jack Sparrow"" series, chronicling the adventures of Jack as a youngster, and the ""Legends of the Brethren Court"" series, which takes place more or less immediately before the mutiny on board of the pearl.

Then there is ""The Price of Freedom"" by A.C.C. Crispin, who is rather well known for writing the Han Solo trilogy in the Star Wars EU, as well as the Spok series in the Star Trek EU. It basically chronicles Jack Sparrows way from pirate, to captain of the East India Trading Company, back to pirate and also includes quite a lot of backstory for Cutler Beckett (who is one of the three perspective characters for the reader).

Then there are a couple of comics of which I sadly do not know that much, as I was never able to get my hands on them. From what I know most of them are only short stories.

Then there are several companion books, though they probably do not count as EU.

And then I am aware of at least two video games that extend the universe to some degree. For one the by now discontinued online game, for the other a game of which I right now cannot quite remember the name, which appeared for PS2 back in the days. It basically chronicled ""The legends of Jack Sparrow - as told by Jack Sparrow"".

Sadly there was not much in terms of extended universe during the last few years. ""The Legends of the Brethren Court"" had 5 instead of the planned 6 volumes, the last of which only actually appeared as an Ebook. ""The Price of Freedom"", which basically released parallel to ""On Strangers Tides"" back in 2011, never got a sequel. For once we do not know, whether one was actually planned (though there is plenty of evidence in the book it was) for the other part the writer sadly passed away a few years ago. So there probably will never be a sequel. There was not much in terms of new video games with some lore during those last years either. Heck, there were basically no video games at all. 

So, yeah. There was some EU happening. But sadly there is not anymore really. :( Kinda sad. I would have *loved* to read more within that universe.",RunnerPakhet

I wouldn't expect someone named The_Jedi_Hunter to expect as much emotion from Will as he did in seeing Han again. A fan of POTC would definitely experience it though. I felt really bad for Henry and Will at the beginning of the movie, and at the end I thought it was pretty touching seeing Will and Elizabeth reunite. 

It's also an extremely unfair comparison, waiting 30 years to see Leia, Han and Luke to waiting what, 10 to see Will? And cultural weight? Sure I haven't seen the Falcon in awhile. The Black Pearl you see in each movie on the other hand. But the Black Pearl is actually an important part of POTC. The Millenium Falcon is just a cool space ship. POTC isn't as popular as Star Wars, but well yeah, it's Star Wars. It's not like only Star Wars can pull off nostalgia. 

And I guarantee fan reception would've been MUCH better if Will had a bigger role in the movie. I was hoping he would show up at the end and save the day. People definitely give a shit about Will and Elizabeth. The lack of most of the cast from the first three movies noticeably had an impact on OST. The movie didn't do bad financially overall either. And just like every other POTC sequel, everyone complains it doesn't feel enough like COTBP. The opposite criticism of TFA. Although, I have seen people often enough say that DMTNT is the most similar POTC sequel to COTBP.

Someone above mentioned that the original film is a ""true heir"" to *Raiders*, but *Raiders* was a lot more economical, and its series never doubled-down on itself and chased epic status the way nearly all modern action-fantasy franchises do (it's like they all decide at some point they're *Lord of the Rings*).",deadandmessedup

Books are essentially screenplays with a lot more detail anyway, they're begging to become movies (if done right, like with Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter). But when you have a game to make a movie from, it's hard, since you're pushing people further from it by forcing a specific character and narrative that the audience doesn't get to play or interact with or change in any way.

I hate him as much as you, but he is nowhere near a major part of the prequel trilogy as a whole. As an entity, the prequels are a very ambitious tragical story of a chosen one who chooses love over duty and the world falls around him because of that. It's not a story type that's told very often in movies nowadays, and I love the idea behind it and most of the execution, even if there are missteps along the way.

The new trilogy is completely lacking a compelling central story that feels like a myth or legend in a Star Wars universe. Instead it's a series of silly adventures where inexplicably our heroes are a rag-tag group of underdogs again, even if they have no right to be, and they somehow overpower their incompetent enemies constantly. It's a big joke, except not even funny with the horrible humor that TLJ demonstrated to us.

I like Kylo, he's the ONLY good character of the new trilogy in my opinion. But he's different than Anakin. He's a person who feels betrayed by the current rule of the world and wants to change it in his image. Anakin was a powerful Jedi who was told he was special all his life, yet he found he was being limited at every corner. He couldn't love, couldn't be a master and as a result he eventually went with his emotions and turned to the dark side. Snoke's demise was interesting but it also left a million questions unanswered and the movie failed to set up the next main threat. Who are we supposed to fear now? Kylo, who is even doubting that the dark side or The First Order have any point? Hux, who is the most incompetent and goofy general ever? ",None

It would allow to explore Jack as a father figure to him and create so many new possibilities for him as a character. 

And Will should've remained the captain of the Flying Dutchman. What I especially liked about the trilogy is that Will and Elizabeth's romance is a tragedy.

Moana 2, Zootopia 2 and Frozen 3 as Epcot & Disney Hong Kong / Shanghai start diversifying away from the Magic Kingdom model. Expect big Spiderman and Avengers news in 2021 or so to coincide with the new Avengers academy thing around the world.

The fourth movie should have started another trilogy, but it and the fifth were just standalone movies with the typical villain of the day plot.

I would rank the first three in this order:

1. Dead Man's Chest - this is when the actors/actresses really honed their respective characters and made them fun to watch. The action sequences were hilarious, the dialogue was witty, and Davy Jones was a great villain who I could relate to at the time. Also Sparrow's ""sacrifice"" at the end was a great scene. Verbinski did a great job integrating all the characters from the first movie, even the most minor and static, and making them funny dynamic characters in the following movies.

2. Curse of the Black Pearl - solid movie throughout.

3. At World's End - In my opinion the weakest of the three. The tone was weird, it was not fun/adventurous at all, too much traveling on boats. but it tied up everything nicely.",peatear_gryphon

I think the trilogy should have been Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End combined into one movie (emphasis on At World's End), and Dead Men Tell No Tales as the ending. Stranger Tides should simply be forgotten, as it just introduced half a dozen new pointless characters who did nothing to deepen the story of the world or the few remaining original characters. Though, Cruz was a badass and Ian McShane made a delightful Blackbeard.

The problem with At World's End is that despite being the second best film in the franchise, it left too many aspect of the story unfinished, most importantly Will and Elizabeth, and Jack's search for immortality. And while Stranger Tides did little to answer those questions, DMTNT did, and gave us an ending that neatly, albeit not as entertainingly, explained why there's no more magic on the high seas, effectively ending these magic pirate stories and Jack's quest.

As per the change to Jack's character in the last two films, by then most of the magic of Depp's performance seemed lost, likely owing to him feeling tired of the role.

To an outsider it looks like it's all randomly coming together but you can tell there's a hint of a plan under it all.

They are both _adorable_, in a film that is ultimately about their character arcs - the two of them undergoing change as a result of meeting a static, unchanging character in Jack Sparrow. As the romance was sidelined more and more in sequels, it became harder for the audience to care about the characters. By the time Disney realized the mistake, it was too late to try and bring them back to center.

As great as Depp is playing Jack, you can't have a real interesting story arc or character development if the whole film was just him. He's a comedic character, and sure he has a backstory that gives him motive, but his arc is really just him acting on that motive. It'd be a Charlie Chaplin movie, but with sound - that doesn't work in this day and age. You don't believe he's going become a good heroic person, he will always be an antihero, but you also don't fear that anything is going to happen to him.

None of these considerations show through with focus testing, and Depp is so spectacular that the conclusion is that he carries the franchise. Black Pearl was very clearly made to be a stand-alone film, but with it's success two more were ordered - and that's where the wheels fall off. 

The first film wrapped up too solidly for sequels. Despite the ending being a bunch of pirates hitting the open seas for adventure, it really is the happy ever after moment where everybody gets what they wanted most: Will gets Elizabeth, Elizabeth gets freedom, and Jack gets the Pearl. Jack even talks about his dream of basically sailing off into the sunset. But they had to build the franchise, tell some story, so they went with the only connection between the first film and a potential expansion of the story - Will's dad. 

It worked okay. But it got strange. Elizabeth signaled that maybe she and Will were complicated. Will ended up being a sea monster. A goddess gets released in the same film where the East India Company makes it seem like the days of piracy are ending. Barbossa is brought back. Kung Fu pirates. And Jack is still a weirdly developed character throughout. 

I think World's End was the end of the Will/Elizabeth story, which is why Stranger Tides did so well at the box office. Will was incredibly bland as a character, because the first film is all he was really developed for. Of course, Tides was as convoluted as any of the films that came before it, critics hated it, and Disney did the dumbest thing possible by trying to bring back Will Turner - and Davy Jones. 

Between Jack cheating death a million times, Barbossa and Jones both cheating on-screen death, and Will continually being a part of the stories, the franchise has made it impossible to take death seriously. It's like old action cartoons from the 80s, like Transformers and GI Joe, where good and evil are constantly throwing down but nobody ever dies.",None

But my point being not only do I feel they lost track of Sparrow's character but they forgot to ground him with more real characters to carry the film.

I've only seen the movie once, but I seem to remember a surprising number of the action scenes took place at night, when you couldn't see shit. That was a weird call.

Jack in the fifth one just felt like a really bad caricature of the character, the film was just lazy and not interesting, I saw twists coming and it didn’t feel like a Pirates film at all.

That's just utterly contrived bullshit and goes completely against the character that was set up in 1-3.

Sure, some of the moments in 1-3 were a little ridiculous, but they still plausibly fell somewhere between 'dumb luck' and 'did he plan that?' which is what made his character great.

The banquet scene is just pure fake unbelievable garbage. Since it's the same writers I can only blame it on the change in director/choreographer. Gore Verbinski kept the essence of the character in check and without him it was lost.

It was kind of a dumb trilogy tbh; its overcomplicated and needlessly melodramatic, and full of goofy filler (the cannibal island) intended to stretch it out, but it works better than the ""Jack Sparrow goes on some adventures I guess"" narrative. It flushes out the world of the first movie into a universe that feels alive and has stakes, shows us some badass characters and concepts, and ends on a pretty good note. There's a love triangle, gods, some great villains, it was a solid piece of lore.

* **Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales** - The split between domestic and foreign for this film only widens as the film had a disasterous second weekend drop of 65% but still the film managed to pass $500M worldwide. The drop is the worst the series has ever experience for a second weekend which was previously held by Dead Man's Chest which dropped 61% after its first weekend set the Memorial Weekend record at the time. At this point the film will almost certainly not pass $200M domestic and may not even pass $150M if drops like this continue. However that doesn't really matter as still the film continues to expand overseas, grossing almost $400M internationally in just two weeks. Obviously a big amount of that was from China where the film has made $142.6M so far, though that may slow down some with Wonder Woman taking up screens. Even so this franchise clearly still has enough foreign interest to keep the franchise going even if domestic audiences are clearly done with the whole thing. 

* **Logan** - Even though it's out on home video, Logan still managed to push past one last record as the film has now passed the worldwide gross of Passion of the Christ, earning $612M so far. That now makes it the 3rd highest grossing R-rated film worldwide under Matrix Reloaded ($742M) and Deadpool ($783M). While Logan probably only has a few weeks left it's been a remarkable box office run and one that helps remind Hollywood that R-rated films can make money.

**Notable film closings**

* **Power Rangers (2017)** - Well I didn't have to follow that for long as just a week after adding it to the follow list Power Rangers has now closed to a weak $85.3M domestic and $140.2M worldwide on a budget of $100M. While the domestic total for the film wasn't incredible it was strong enough that a good international showing could have helped the film, but in that department it failed miserably. The film only made $54.8M overseas and in China made just $4M. Fans of the series though shouldn't completely dismiss a possible sequel as apparently increased toy sales in Power Rangers merch may help keep it afloat (same thing that kept the Star Trek films going). However if there is a sequel expect a significant budget cut and much more focus on the American side of things. 

* **Unforgettable** - Oh the puns you can make when a movie called Unforgettable quickly leaves cinemas earning just $11.3M domestic and $15.1M worldwide on a budget of $12M. The erotic thriller was clearly hoping its lead stars could carry the film to some level of success but ultimately the film flopped in opening then got booted out of theaters quickly. I guess you could say it was...a bad movie. 

* **Sleight** - Another easy pun as this low budget indie released by Blumhouse closed to a small but profitable $3.9M domestic	(no worldwide release) on a budget of just $250K. The film was an indie darling at Sundance 2016 and was bought up by BH Tilt, a rare move from them. It worked as the film got good reviews and had a solid little life at the bottom of the box office and like all BH Tilt movies should earn a couple more million from VOD and streaming sales.

Why, it's almost like women are a huge untapped audience for mainstream entertainment or something. 

It's not that women don't like, say, tentpole superheroics. It's just that they've been executed so often in ways that were at best tone-deaf that the execution alienated a lot of them.

The action was great, the humor was mostly on point, and the plot was legitimately interesting but it all had to bottom out every time I was forced to watch Pine and Gadot's blooming love connection. Which led to a line that I audibly laughed at how terribly cliche it was ""I do this for love!"" or whatever. 

I grew up a Marvel kid, so maybe Pine's character was deeply important but I would have enjoyed it so much more without stupid schlock like the 'Oooh you have such a big ol dick' scene and the prelude to sex scene. 

I do want to emphasize that I think it's a great movie. The trench warfare scene might be my favorite action sequence in any superhero movie ever. I just really hated the love story piece of the plot.  ",ivtecdoyou

In terms of solo superhero origin movies, it is now #4 behind Deadpool, Man of Steel, and Spider-Man in opening numbers.

Does this account for inflation?

Either way pretty impressive though, since it does include some films that have come out recently and are thus comparable even without adjustments. Given how reviled DCEU is, the fact that WW could beat any MCU film that's come out in the last few years is something WB should celebrate.",elendinel

1. More shitty low-budget animated movies like Captain Underpants flopping. Illumination has set a precedent of ""Make whatever sells the most toys using the lowest amount of money"" and it is ruining the art form of animation, seeing how Dreamworks has caught on. Luckily we still have Disney, who has a lot more at stake when it comes to making animated films, as their theme parks and merchandising are highly dependent on Disney's ability to create amazing new stories in the cinema- but even they are turning into a sequel machine (which I don't quite fully understand seeing how Zooptopia and Frozen were original and made over a billion). If Cars 3 also can flop (Even though it won't) and Coco can outperform it, those problems may be fixed. That being said, Despeciable Me 3 is going to do really well regardless unfortunately, but since those films haven't been THAT awful I'm fine with that.

2. Shitty expanded universe films flopping. Marvel, and DC now apparently, can make good films and having an expanded universe makes sense for them- but turning ""The Mummy"" into some sort of expanded universe is not what we want and hopefully this weekend's box office proves that.

3. (Good) original films doing great. This will actually be a given seeing as A24, especially after their best picture win, is making more original films that look incredible- and is also advertising them very well.

3. Netflix needs to continue their summer domination- last summer's shitfest of films were totally overshadowed by Stranger Things on social media and total views. Hopefully Okja can be a similar powerhouse film but I'm a little hesistant (The film looks fantastic but might be a little bit unappealing to general audiences. Hoepfully the amazing cast sells people)",HoliestDonut

I have loved the DCEU since MoS and I'm glad DC finally got a film that was loved by critics. That being said, I still like Batman V Superman and Man of Steel more.

The record smashing and precedent setting of Wonder Woman is a joy to see. I hope we see more female characters getting center stage, especially in regards to Marvel characters.

Here is a personal anecdote:

A week before Wonder Woman opened, my coworkers, friends and I had talked about Wonder Woman (among other upcoming summer movies.)  All of us had decided that we were *NOT* interested in seeing Wonder Woman.  We had seen the last two DC movies,  Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, and they sucked.  We knew Wonder Woman belongs to the same same franchise and universe.  So we expected Wonder Woman to also suck like the last movies from the same production pipeline.  

When Wonder Woman's Rotten Tomatoes score came out, (which was initially 97%,) I was intrigued.  Then I got an offer of a 3D IMAX ticket for only US$4 (from T-Mobile in the US.) So I though, what the heck, let's see it for $4.  Why not. I saw it. I really enjoyed it.  It did not suck like Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad.  It was very good.  It has some weak points, like the slow-mo action and the big battle in the final act, whose style and tone are recongizably  Zack Snyder's.  Fortunately, Patty Jenkin's direction for the rest of the movie is strong enough to overcome Snyder's minor ""contributions"" (or, more appropriately, burdens) to the movie.

None of my coworkers and friends has seen it yet. They are still wary of Wonder Woman due to  Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad.  After seeing Wonder Woman, I recommended it to them.  So they will likely see it this weekend.  (However, I am still do not plan to see seeing Justice League because Zack Snyder - urgh - directed it. So no thanks.)",None

You had the ONE female superhero, Wonder Woman, that is as well known as the major male superheroes, which she never had a movie made about her before, which got glowing reviews... There isnt another female superhero character like her.

You also have Trump and the campaign we just went through and the big women's march months ago.. That all made this movie come out at exactly the right time. Its circumstances that will very likely never be duplicated again.

The fact is comics books with male SHs and movies with male SHs is what sell because the audience is young men and that's what young men want to see.

Even as well as WW did with it coming at exactly the right time, it still won't make as much as 2nd tier male SHs like Doctor Strange or Deadpool.

The portrayal of WWI was just bad and he own morals aren't really consistent.

She signed on to the first Thor because Branagh was attached. 

But yeah, I would have liked to see Jenkins' take on Thor 2, couldn't have been worse. 

What she did well was the ""fish out of water"" jokes -- which coincidentally is what Thor's cinematic humor has aimed at but hasn't really been consistent in executing. 

Jenkins proved she can portray gods and goddesses and their empires well, and she probably would have done a better job with the Thor jokes by hopefully cutting the intern character out completely and toning Darcy down like 5 notches. 

Then again, like others have mentioned, she may have seen the script and said ""no fucking way am I going to direct the worst Marvel script and basically blacklist female directors from big budget films in doing so.""",Death_Star_

I was to the point of saying ""if I get a half baked story and extended edition later, DC can go to hell"".

Wonder Woman is a nice cohesive story all the way through that I fucking LOVED. I wouldn't be mad for an extended cut later on since I feel my money was well earned for just the theatrical release. 

It was also wonderfully refreshing seeing a hero that so desperately wanted to help people and animals, then went out of their way to do so. She wasn't just begrudgingly doing it because it's what's expected of her. She wanted to help the horses out of the mire, she wanted to help the man in pain because his leg was cut/blown off, she wanted to help the people regain their town. 

This embodiment of Wonder Woman was exactly the hero we needed to see now. Not these other heroes being steered by government agencies or pushed on by remorse/vengeance/what's expected of them. We needed that someone who was pure of heart who wanted to help because they could. This movie deserves all the accolades coming to it and so much more. Stay on point, DC.

People are feeling more comfortable with this style now, and I bet a lot of viewers would like MoS and BvS a lot better after another viewing.",worm_dude

Always thought it was a cheesy and dated character.  I felt the same about Captain America.

So I'll be going in just about blind having only peripheral knowledge of the character, and I'm hoping the movie will do for me what marvel has done with Cap - i.e. Make me realize how awesome this character is/can be.

Honestly, sometimes it's just great to go into these movies with no knowledge or expectations.  A lot of comic movies it's kind of like I know exactly what I'm going to get and aren't very surprised even when I enjoy them.  There aren't many I can go into damn near blind and let the film stand entirely on its own material for me.  Was the same for Guardians of the Galaxy - had no clue what to expect as I never got into the galactic tales of marvel, just knew I loved James Gunn's movies and marvel.

Gal Gadots acting is lackluster at best - she is beautiful but is not a trained or talented actor and it shows. She has all the acting chops of a wet sock. She has her moments, she gave me a laugh here and there- sure. But a talented actor makes you believe they really ARE that character. I never believed Gal Gadot was WW at any point - and i guess some of that blame falls on the writers as well, she just didnt act like ""Diana"" would, its hard to explain i guess unless you are a fan of the animated shows / comics. The example that comes to mind is the ""Oh, a baby!!"" scene. I dont understand why everyone seems to love this scene. WW would not act / react like that. Put any other superhero in that same situation and i think you'll see how weird and out of place it is.

with the exception of the last fight sequence, the CG for many of the parts for what i imagine must be  a high budget film was just AWFUL. The scene where she fights with the German tank, where she jumps out of the trench in no mans land, and anytime shes fighting a large amount of people with her lasso, the end shot where she is flying come to mind and just looked like absolute hot garbage, but there were more i am missing as well. Strangely (as i mentioned) the last fight sequence was good and the CG was good as well. I fell like they use all their CG budget there and the rest of the movie suffered for it.

The plot was passable, but shoe horning and pushing the romance with Chris Pine made it suffer greatly. Not only did it not really have any needed place in the story, it actually detracts a lot from WW as a superhero. I would have very much liked to see her on screen as a kicks-ass-dont-need-no-man role.

I also felt that while the jokes in the movie were funny mostly - there were to many of them, they were to easy to make, and kind of felt like beating a dead horse. Its like yes, we get it - Gal Gadot is gorgeous. You're a bad writer if you need to make 3 variations of the same sexually charged joke in a 2 hour movie.

The side characters were also not fleshed out nearly enough.

All that being said, i did still enjoy the move, it was worth the ticket price - I just dont think i would ever have any need to see it again.",filenotfounderror

I'm not trying hate on it, I'm excited for Gal Gadot and thought she did a lot with practically nothing but it seems like DC has no interest in hiring writers for their movies.   

They changed Steve Trevor from a WWII pilot to WWI seemingly to avoid the almost embarrassingly obvious similarity to the first Captain America movie but it seemed to just make the whole motley crew aspect even more cringeworthy.    

Danny Huston had far too much screen time and David Thewlis seemed completely miscast as Ares when they could have just had Dr. Poison really be Ares and then have a proper woman to woman fight, you know, two female leads instead of just the one.   

It seemed to experience all the pitfalls of a Snyder movie without him directing it somehow. 

I wanted to like this movie so much and I was really let down. For perspective, I saw this with my older sister who literally has waited her entire life for this moment and even she couldn't get fully swept up in the momentum of the occasion.   

The Themyscira stuff was cool. I felt like that had well-defined relationships and stakes, and then they have to have Diana run away embarrassed, which was really jarring. It felt like a bad teen movie and not in a self-aware, satirical way.   

Was really hoping to be more on board with DC after watching Wonder Woman, especially considering what Gal Gadot accomplished with crap writing but, I mean, love will save the world is the theme? *Really?*  

Again, not an attack on anyone's opinion. I'm thrilled for what this might mean for the industry as a movie fan and a fan of women in general. I just don't know why everyone likes it so much.

I loved the first movie but I have no clue how it cost 100m considering the quality of the CGI, the lack of action and no name actors. It had 50m written all over it but there we are. I think they need to be very careful with the money next time round, because if the budget was cut in half the movie would have been a small success.

Such a shame since it was a genuinely good movie with a nice focus on character that treated the brand with far more respect than some would say it deserved.

Or are we talking about looking feminine? As feminine is defined: thin, graceful, not bulky or muscular, gentle, meek, passive, emotional.

I've been researching this lately and it seems like ""acting like a man"" and ""acting like a warrior"" sort of blend together.

This often happens when male writers and directors try to portray a strong, female character.

I really don't see what all the hype is about. It's nowhere near as bad as BvS, but it's definitely not a great movie. It has a lot of pathos and a good opening, but then it gets seriously boring. Gadot has no gravitas whatsoever for her character. She looks like she wondered off the set of a Fast & Furious movie and they decided to cast her because she does indeed look magnificent as WW. But that's all she does, look picture perfect when she poses or does something in slow motion. And the supporting characters are just woefully forgettable. The movie turns into Dragonball Z by the end, with a twist I could see coming from a mile away. The music is also just awful. Overly dramatic and completely out of step with how campy the movie slowly becomes.

Only the first part of the movie is any good, while it's in Themyscira. Thanks no doubt to the acting talents of Robin Right and Connie Nielsen. As soon as the main characters leave the island it just turns to shit.

A lot was riding on the success of this movie and it wasn't just WBs pocketbook at stake: Hollywood has long had the impression that women are a less attractive market than men and that blockbusters should only use women in supporting roles (and never behind the camera in the director's seat). 

I know that there are a lot of people piously saying that they *only* judge movies on their quality but, in the real world, there are more factors at play.

Captain America had the super Hitler problem that a lot of WWII set fantasy has.

Setting it in WWI doesn't have that problem to begin with, and the way the film handled the villain even ended up using the WWI setting extremely effectively. 

Further Diana and Steve are extremely moral good guy characters who you know are never really going to make the right choice. Those types of characters only really become interesting when there's a morally grey background world that challenges them. Winter soldier and civil war were great captain America movies, but it's really damn hard to make a movie about fighting nazis that isn't a good guy vs bad guy narrative, so the first captain America movie was a good guy doing good things for the goodies.

I'm female and didn't want this to turn into a feminist manifesto straight out of tumblr's more crazy back rooms. All that concern was for nothing. It was very well done. 


The next movie I am dying to see on this end of the spectrum will be Jason Momoa as Aquaman. I can't understand why anyone needs to separate everything along gender lines like it is a fucking NFL season and you can only root for ""your team."" Wonder Woman was a damn fine movie for ""people"" to enjoy.

Diana nuked everything she set out to do or had a hunch on, and she never seemed to be in danger or wrong.  I get she is WW, but you can have the character struggle emotionally and culturally, especially outside of Themyscira.  They kind of made a half-assed attempt at this with the manly war room scene, and when she was getting fitted for traditional clothes, but honestly none of these cultural differences held her back in any significant regard, and it was all quickly dismissed for the next scene.  

The love story was pretty uneventful and linear, I would of liked to see something challenge Steve and Diana's relationship as it was evolving.

The villains were comically bad, like Saturday morning cartoon cardboard cutout bad.  They had no real story outside being really evil for no reason other than having something for Diana to fight at the end.  She meets them pretty much a minute before the final battle, so significant emotional or narrative connection between them and the good guys was pretty much impossible.

What was so good about that movie?

For me, WW had a great cast that worked off each other. Gadot and Pine were charismatic as all hell. The story was pretty tight in terms of who the villain was and why they had to stop him. I thought the comedic moments were natural and didn't feel forced. I liked that WW did everything she could to help people. She showed true anguish when she couldn't stop the chemical raid. The movie did a pretty good job showing the horrors of war compared to other comic movies. She showed true heroism when she charged no mans land. It was rare when it felt WW wasn't in charge. 

Overall, I liked the three action sequences and loved all the characters. It felt big in scope but had a very direct story. WW had a very well developed character arc that was easy to follow. Not perfect but far better than a lot of the comic movies that have come out this generation. ",brahbocop

I like the difference between her and superman with their super strength. Superman, not having been trained in fighting just wreck shit with his strength, no grace or agility. Wonder Woman, because she has been trained she has a much more fluid and intense? fighting style. However, personally for the reveal of Ares, i saw that coming a mile off.

- #41 in worldwide box office opening weekend 225.5M (~22M short of the next closest Superhero film Logan, and ~2M better than Iron Man 2)

Notes: 

- Question marks for movies that should be on the domestic list but somehow aren't
- I might have missed some, google searches are absolutely fucked because of everyone spamming the ""smashes multiple records for women opening box office"" line.
- The cut off for domestic rankings is 10m, I included Big because it's top 15 all time gross for a female directed film
-  I didn't include worldwide or foreign because only Frozen managed to crack that list
- A lot of repeat directors because they're the highest grossing women directors of all time, they each make solid films that average around 100m+ at the box office.
- I may have missed some of Penelope Spheeris' work, she has a large filmography and for some reason Boxofficemojo doesn't have a page for her (she's not even listed on some of these films)

Essentially you get two different narratives about context:

1) That the proper context for the film is to compare it to other films directed by women. The point is to show off how women are just as capable as men, and you do that by highlighting how few chances they've had. IMO, as you can see above is completely unfair since none of the movies can compare to a $149M budgeted comic book movie. Most of these movies didn't even have half of that for a budget. Some of them probably didn't even have WW's advertising budget for their entire movie. Not to take away the accomplishment from Jenkins, but essentially all you had to do is give any woman the reigns to a superhero film, sit back while they do a good job, and they would have broken the exact same records. I don't think it's controversial here to say that average or worse established franchise movies can make serious money due to the current viewer trends. Transformers, Suicide Squad, have all been talked about this way and still make a lot of money etc. The top record holders in pretty much every stat are held by sequels, franchises, etc that came out since 2000 more or less. 

Just to do the same that I did at the top using the comparative comic book openings to determine overall gross: 

The closest woman directed competition WW has is Twilight which opened about 4 million higher than X-Men: Apocalypse and 16 million worse than X-Men Origins: Wolverine (the closest comic book film). Neither film hit 200m total box office. If we dick around with the math and multiply WW's opening box office difference over some of those top films we get the following expectations:

Movie | Gross
---|---
Ant-Man | #163 w/  514.4M
X-Men: The Last Stand | #199 w/ 459.3M
Star Wars: TFA | #3 w/ 2,068.2M
The Avengers | #5 w/ 1,518.8M
Man of Steel| #100 w/ 668.0M
Doctor Strange | #97 w/ 677.7M
The Amazing Spider-Man | #75 w/ 757.9M
Guardians of the Galaxy | #71 w/ 773.3M

Essentially 1.5-2B is above average, 700M is average, and 600 is below average, with 400-500 being extremely poor. Of course, this is all offset by Frozen's total take, so 700 is above average, 600 is average, and 400-500 is below average. Similar predictions to the above, but that's because I compared it to overall takes and comic book movies.
 
2) That the proper context for the film is to compare it to other superhero films directed by everyone. Imagine for a second there were like 10 women in the NBA who all do a solid jobs in their rolls, but they get limited time or playing style. Now imagine a new player comes onto the scene (yes, Jenkins directed Monster and some TV stuff) and she has a top 50 of all time performance. It would be really weird to constantly lower the bar to ""best female player ever"" rather than pointing to her real achievement (top 50 player). There's a huge difference between outplaying solid players who haven't had a chance to be great versus being on the same level as Shaq, Scottie Pippen, Isaiah Thomas, etc. One of these is obvious, but doesn't let you know how well they actually did. The other lets you know exactly how well they did. I mean, the thing here is that everyone knows at this point that Jenkins is a woman, no one needs reminding of that, Hollywood included. I have a feeling that if some bigwig wants to get sales numbers, they aren't reading Vanity, Forbes, or f5ing on Boxofficemojo to get the stats from their own movie. I guarantee they have their own sources straight from the horse's mouth. However, there seems to be a lot of people, particularly in the film focused journalist area who have mistaken ideas about where the power in Hollywood is. They think that by shotgunning an opinion piece into the overall audience, that might somehow have an effect. The problem is, that's not who controls this stuff. The real choices are being made by a handful of individuals in an office somewhere on the West Coast. It's those people whose minds you have to change, and I guarantee if any of those writers wanted to they could track down some of the problematic people. My assumption though is because there's so much paid advertising out in the internet, that many are afraid of losing money by going after people who are the real problem.",Hail_Britannia

If both companies want to have a good, long run of franchise films, they are really going to have to take some risks with their choices of director, screenwriter and producer.

I'm hoping that Disney will set the pace with their approach to Star Wars and The Last Jedi.  But, if that turns out to be yet another rose-colored, nostalgia recycling machine, I'm going to be done with Star Wars, too!

The third act is problematic.  The reveal of the villain is meant to be surprise, but comes off more a wtf.  The final battle is the usual bright lights and smashy-smashy, but it becomes too fantastic compared to the more grounded and realistic battle scenes that preceded it.

The mythology is laid out quite well, not too long and wordy, but enough for you to get the gist.

The second act is also quite fun as she plays the fish-out-water in London trying on clothes that you can't fight in and making all the old men look like idiots because she's the smartest person in the room and can speak ALL Earth languages.

The third act is problematic. The reveal of the villain is meant to be surprise, but comes off more a wtf. The final battle is the usual bright lights and smashy-smashy, but it becomes too fantastic compared to the more grounded and realistic battle scenes that preceded it.

I'd still recommend it. It's not great, but it is a very good start.

But after all that *still* no female or black superhero solo film. I know it's in the works now (Captain Marvel and Black Panther). But jesus, feels like it's taking forever.

No it doesn't. The problem with that video is the same problem as all of Wisecrack's armchair philosophy videos. They'll find a few similarities between a piece of media and one philosopher or philosophical tradition and then blow the whole thing out of proportion. 

For example, at 6:15 they say about Reeves Superman that he ""doesn't save people for his own betterment but simply because it's the right thing to do."" In the BvS scene where they show the montage of Superman saving people they literally say the exact thing, one of the talking heads explicitly mentions that ""Maybe he's just a guy trying to do the right thing.""

The whole criticism is stupid, you know what a rational egoist with superpowers would do? Probably take over the world, not help people. Ultraman can be argued to be a rational egoist, Injustice Superman can be argued to be a rational egoist, but this Superman isn't anywhere near that. ",DruggedOutCommunist

Would not be surprised at all. There's little word of mouth about it, and all of Cruise's most recent films that weren't a Mission Impossible movie haven't done too well on opening weekend. Since his biggest opening weekend with War of the Worlds in 2005 ($67M), here's how much his non-MI movies have debuted to:

* Lions for Lambs - $6.7M
* Tropic Thunder - $25.8M
* Valkyrie - $21.0M
* Knight & Day - $20.8M
* Rock of Ages - $14.4M
* Jack Reacher - $15.2M
* Oblivion - $37.0M
* Edge of Tomorrow - $28.7M
* Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - $22.8M

Also the last movie in the Mummy franchise opened to $40.5M so I think your prediction is right on point.

DC fans have lashed back against the criticism of the Snyder movies with the argument being ""Well they shouldn't be giddy silly movies like Marvel.  We like the darker tone.""

That's fine.  The darker tone suits DC.  But you can have a darker movie and still have it be *fun*.  Batman v Superman isn't just dark, it's joyless.  It's slow and plodding and self important.

Wonder Woman hits a lot of the same beats, slowmo fight scenes.  Powerful heroes being heroes in the midst of horror moments.  Real on screen death.  

But it also knows when to lighten up the mood.  It knows how long its action ought to take.  It knows how much destruction you should have going before an audience gets bored of all the splosions.  It handles the whole thing with a much more deft hand than I ever expected.  It's a breath of fresh air.  It's something you can build this cinematic universe around.",djc6535

* you compared it to suicide squad. I get that they gathered the characters from the comics directly but they could have watered down the stereotypes A LITTLE; especially for a movie to be this ""progressive"" . An irish guy who is a drunk. An indian named Chief who throughout the movie, just made fires. A Spanish guy who is the creepy ""ladies man"". And the ruthless german. 

* I get that every single movie has to have a love interest side plot, but with this movie it just felt frivolous. Because we saw WW in BvS, we know she ages slower than humans i guess. Because of that, we know he HAS to die at the end of the movie. No way we're going to see WW still in her 20s, with an 80 year old.

The ending was insipid in my mind; but the acting, the overall story-telling, the dialogs - there was a lot of genuineness and honesty to it. The last movie that made me feel this way was Man Of Steel.

While yes the villains fell flat, there was actual meaningful character development and transition with Wonder Woman since it's not another me too rehash that tries to cram in every possible tenuous superhero relationship into the mix. 

There was enough in the story where I wasn't able to predict every little nuance like the bad guy or the emotional scene at the end.

Compare it to say Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Captain America Civil War or really any sequel Marvel movie and you have a much richer storyline that makes the character shine which is what makes these initial origin movies so much better if they're done right.",dworldlife

I personally give it an 8.5/10

The love story was WAY too much of the movie, and in my opinion isn't even necessary. They could have easily made it a platonic relationship or even an unreciprocated affection from Pine for some easy jokes. Instead you're left with a large chunk of the film dedicated to showing a relationship that you know 100% won't work out since Wonder Woman is basically immortal. 

The early dick joke scene with awkward pausing was downright bad, and the later recall to that scene in the ""I'm above average"" line didn't even really fit. 

Wonder Woman, who is portrayed as deeply intelligent, is not familiar with the concept of marriage but she can speak ""hundreds of languages"". She knows about sex and the entire reproductive system and is apparently familiar with the concept of a man's role in the context of not needing them beyond sperm, but is completely unfamiliar with the concept of marriage. 

Kids are almost always bad actors. Adorable does not equal good, and the young Diana scene in the beginning is bad. Small nitpick but I see people in this thread praising it. 

Some of the CGI towards the end was pretty mediocre as well. 

Overall, it was a good movie, and I think has crept it's way up into my top 5 superhero movies but I feel like a lot of people viewed this movie through rose colored glasses in the name of feminism. ",ivtecdoyou

But for some reason this was the first time Marvel or DC tapped a female director to make a major film for them. Hopefully this encourages them to hire more female talent in the future.

And I think Wonder Woman had more of an uphill battle than the rest of the DCEU films. The previous films have been divisive at best, and that's lowered some of the excitement for them. BvS and SS both benefited from being able to feature Batman And Joker in their promotional material, and SS also had the star power of Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

This is a success in the sense that the Wonder Woman tried to set itself up as a more or less independent franchise. The trailers didn't feature heavy handed references to Batman or Superman. They didn't feature actors of quite the caliber of Will Smith, Margot Robbie, or Jared Leto. But people still showed up for it.",talllankywhiteboy

That's silly, I can think of a very reasonable explanation: Women directors aren't interested in directing ""major Hollywood films"".

Should producers just pull them off the street and plunk them in the chair and stick a megaphone in their hand?

Do you have any evidence that shows women are being actively discriminated against? 

Edit: To clarify my point slightly. I'm not saying women are choosing to not make movies. I'm saying without any evidence this is as reasonable a conclusion as sexism (that is to say, not reasonable at all). Jumping to the conclusion that the reason female directors don't direct high budget films is sexism, despite the fact some film execs are women, and half the population of the film going public are women, doesn't address the very real disparity in the genders of big budget film directors.

That said, it handles the character very well. Gender is handled gracefully, not shoving feminism in your face while portraying Wonder Woman as strong, but with her own flaws. The romantic side-plot was well-done as well, not coming on too heavy or sexualized, and the relationship was never ""damsel in distress"" trope or inverted trope. It felt like they treated each other as equals, even with Wonder Woman being, well, superpowered. There also weren't too any glaring plotholes that I can remember, nothing that had me lost.

That's all that I liked about the film. There are parts I dislike as well. For instance, the whole story seems to be leading up to this realization, yet it all seems to fall flat on Wonder Woman. She grew as a person in theory, completing an arc, but it feels incomplete and unsatisfying because it feels as if she's ending up in the same place. And, while I enjoyed the badassery of the action, I personally felt like the slow motion took away some of my immersion. I've heard other opinions which enjoyed it, so to each their own on this topic. There is also the side cast. Personally, I enjoyed the personalities, they were memorable. However, the movie doesn't make use of these characters much. They seem to have half an arc, and don't feel like they were really that important for Wonder Woman's arc nor the story as a whole.

As I view it, her arc was her flaw of seeing the world in blacks and whites, an ideal world where good and evil were exclusive to each other and clearly defined. The natural conclusion, I feel, should have been realizing that the world isn't black and white, instead full of grey areas. But, because of this and that, it feels as if WW's views were enforced rather than disillusioned, even though ""technically"" she understands that there is good and evil in everyone, it feels as if she still defines people as good (with some evil) or evil (with some good). She goes from a black and white perception with a slightly grey black and white perception. I just feel there was little character development for her.

Again, good performance, nice character chemistry, badass action. Stretches its action a little too long for me with slo-mo [to each their own on this], some wasted opportunities, and a stumble backward on the finale. Overall, I give it a 7.5/10, but no doubt DC's first hit. Leaves concern for the future, but shows that they can do it if they try.

If you show a child a Picasso and he makes one; do you not show him how it is compared to the real Picasso?     
  
By only comparing the child to other shitty children's paintings you're lowering the bar for them and therefore stifling progress.  
  
I just can't see how congratulating a person entirely based on their sex isn't a fucked up thing to do in this day and age.  
  
Especially for something creative.  
  
But I'm also arguing against congratulating a woman on reddit so it's not like I don't expect the down votes.   
  

Furthermore, for the argument of Hollywood being sexist; we should congratulate the studio for being the outlier in Hollywood and giving the budget to a woman. Therefore modifying the status quo. They should be praised for that if that is a problem in Hollywood. 
  
But this is congratulating a woman solely because she's a woman. That's fucked up.

Just because it's rarer, doesn't mean it should be completely absent.

Batman is better when he has a sense of humour, because it makes it that much better when he laughs at something - he's scary and intimidating one moment, but some of his best moments are from when he's soft, and caring, and loosens up a little. Those moments are rare and you need to pick them rarely, but they're still there.

Superman should mostly be the inverse. I don't understand Snyder's obsession with making him grim-dark. He's unmistakably light-hearted. He dresses in a *bright blue costume*. However, just like some of Batman's best moments are from when he's soft and caring, some of Superman's best moments are from where the superhero facade drops and he's forced to reconcile the responsibility of ultimate power with his own personal rage.

Comedy is *also* a very important part of pacing. You need moments of levity in between moments of darkness. The contrast makes the darker moments even darker.",Kain222

Wonder Woman was, IMO, better than anything Marvel Studios has released since the first GotG. I didn't think it was a great movie in the general sense, but it was the best non R-rated superhero movie I've seen in quite a while. 

To the extent that it's graded on a curve, I think it's in that all superhero movies are graded on a curve. Okay is good, good is great. And Wonder Woman was... pretty good, which makes it a great comic book movie. Sure, it was a bit formulaic, derivative, and predictable, but that's pretty much intrinsic to the genre. Which I think kinda aligns with your point if you expand it out to comic book movies in general: that even a 7/10 becomes an 8.5-9/10 when you throw the generous comic book movie curve at it.

Honestly, even this post probably suggests a higher opinion of it than I really had. I didn't think it was amazing, and if it ends up being one of the 10 best movies I see this year I'll feel pretty let down. But I think that's mostly a genre criticism, and if you removed the things that held it back in my eyes you would no longer have a comic book movie at all. It wouldn't be what it's supposed to be.

Think of the kind of build up that is in the Marvel shows on Netflix. The movie took way too long to get going for only 15 minutes of them as the rangers. I wanted it to do great but there was literally countless things they could have done better. Hoping for a sequel with the Green Ranger though.,Synergy5

The Kents tell superman he should protect himself and that he doesn't owe people anything but their own actions aren't in line with that. Pa Kent sacrifices himself in the tornado to protect Clark's secret and even though that's stupid it's also very selfless. I think their played well as loving parents who care about their son above all and want him to be safe and happy so they're not going to tell him that he's responsible for fixing the world's problems or that he had to be nice to the people who treat him like he's a monster. However their example is not the same as their words so superman is formed by doing as his parents do not as they say. This way Clark's experience of humanity is loving parents who never asked anything of him and tried their best to protect him as much as possible but he still gets the idea of sacrificing to help others being a good thing.,TheawfulDynne

More than anything, Objectivists believe that nobody is ever *obligated* to do jack shit for other people.  They don't believe that anyone has any kind of obligation to others, which is a complete contradiction of the entire character of Superman.

That's why Snyder's Pa Kent is so weird.  From Snyder's point of view, if Pa Kent told Clark that he had a duty to use his powers to help others, then that would mean that Pa Kent is either an evil, manipulative collectivist or an irrational moron (a sucker, or dupe, of the evil collectivists).

So basically Snyder's Pa Kent (and Ma Kent) don't make sense because they are being used to teach Objectivist morality to Clark, and to most people Objectivist morality is counter-intuitive nonsense.  It rings false because, philosophically speaking, it's a load of horseshit. ",Blood_and_Brass

Hemsworth had the best lines tbh) was that it kept referencing back to the original. It probably could have been a fine film, had it gone its own way. But it had to follow the original Ghostbusters plot for the most part, and had to keep dropping cameos and references so any time they started doing anything original, they'd go ""But hey, remember how great the first one was?""

Best example: They're looking at places to buy, and go to the famous firehouse. I audibly groan because I thought they were going to just set up shop there, but instead they get a Chinese restaurant. Great! New location to establish your own story in. And at the end? Nope, just kidding. We bought the firehouse for some reason. The original Ghostbusters bought it because it was shitty and cheap.

Articles like this are meant to create buzz that encourages more women to go into directing. You can't complain that there aren't enough female directors applying for positions to be represented in the industry and then also complain when articles like this are released that try to promote women to go into directing. If we actually listened to both of your complaints then the number of women in directing would just stagnate or would be slowly increasing. Is that what you really want?  

The implication you keep spouting is completely made up. Obama was the first black president, so does this mean that mentioning his race automatically implies that we think he can't do just as good a job because of his race. 

Similarly, this director is one of the first women to direct such an expensive film so it should be celebrated so that more women will feel encouraged to choose this line of work. You just put a really dark spin on something that is supposed to be happy and optimistic for no good reason.

No, it doesn't. It implies that historically, they haven't when it comes to blockbusters - which is true, it's true for a host of reasons, and a big critical and box office success like this helps to smash down a lot of those reasons and pave the way for future successes like this one. It opens the door for more women to be given a chance to direct tentpole flicks, a chance they've rarely been afforded in the past. That's why this is significant.

I always had my suspicion that the MCU wouldn't have even bothered with a female led movie had it not been requested so much. Feige (sp?) mentioned in an interview that him and his team genuinely read comments online and take it to heart. Any time an article was posted about the desire for a solo Widow movie the majority of the comments were along the lines of ""if any Marvel heroine should get her own movie it should be Ms Marvel"". The comments were always full of that same one comment. And next thing you know (maybe a year or so later) Marvel announces they'll be making a Captain Marvel movie.

This quote from the Wonder Woman director also makes me a bit hopeful that the DCEU might be moving out of its grimdark phase:

> Did you say cheesy? Cheesy is one of the words banned in my world. I’m tired of sincerity being something we have to be afraid of doing. It’s been like that for 20 years, that the entertainment and art world has shied away from sincerity, real sincerity, because they feel they have to wink at the audience because that’s what the kids like. We have to do the real stories now. The world is in crisis.

> I wanted to tell a story about a hero who believes in love, who is filled with love, who believes in change and the betterment of mankind. I believe in it. It’s terrible when it makes so many artists afraid to be sincere and truthful and emotional, and relegates them to the too-cool-for-school department. Art is supposed to bring beauty to the world.

Description | MP3: http://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/3707/the-truth-about-wonder-woman Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/stefan-molyneux/fdr-3707-the-truth-about-wonder-woman  The artistry, charm and special effects – and one powerful twist – are the only things that rescue Wonder Woman from its own stultifying clichés: 1. A female-run society is a paradise. 2. Women are great warriors. 3. the hot Amazon supermodel librarian. 4. The incomprehensibly jealous and angry villain.

Meanwhile Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie opens to a weak #2 with $23.5M but cost only $38M to make.",dihzgmf,2017-06-05 19:49:01,"I'm not so sure it is a bad sign.  Let's say I have a great movie to release.  I'm confident most critics will like it.  In fact, I'm confident almost all mainstream critics will like it.

Now obviously I don't want critics to start reviewing the movie two weeks out, otherwise the media might be done talking about it and have moved on by the time the film releases.

So should I let critics start talking about it a week before?  That would *seem* to be the best option, because then I get a whole week of people talking up my movie until it releases.  The only reason not to do this is if a lot of people are going to be saying bad things.

But this thinking is rooted in a pre-aggregator, pre-clickbait worldview.  Today the first thing people talk about when talking about critical reception is *Rotten Tomatoes*.  Many people no longer even bother to read the reviews, they just look at the RT score and decide based on that.  So as a film distributor, I want to have the highest RT score on release day possible.  I want 100%, or as close to it as I can get.

But here's the problem: _**Clickbait reviews.**_.  Let's say my film is absolutely *awesome*, and no reasonable critic could find fault with it, except on purely subjective terms - like how I dislike any movie with Juliette Lewis on account of finding her forehead mysteriously disturbing and unsettling.

That'd be great, right?  Except not, because movie reviewers -- and *especially* online reviewers -- feed on attention, and how do you get attention by being the 10th guy to say it's a great movie?  Or the 20th?  Or the 50th?  You don't.  So instead, you say something trollish and attention-grabbing, like ""Why Popular Movie Everyone Likes Actually Sucks.""  Each of those kind of reviews is going to bump my RT rating down (like how Wonder Woman dropped from 99% to 93% in a couple of days).

So basically I want to end the embargo on reviews until the as close to release as possible to maximize the first wave of positive reviews, but avoid getting dinged by backlash/trolling reviews, to create the most positive impression in low-information moviegoers.",Blood_and_Brass

It was more... consistent with the feel of an actual comic book?  The fight scenes too.  Lots of Marvel action scenes are just jump cuts that give off none of the feel that the action in traditional comic panels give off.  Especially in the latter half of the WW we got a bunch of really vibrant shots that looked like they could have been a panel in a comic.

That's a valid point, but I'd argue that there are so many more problems that start after leaving Themyscira that go far beyond just coloring. It suddenly becomes a completely worse movie. Some things include:

1. Far fewer establishing shots. Probably a consequence of too much green screen. Through out the rest of the movie it's common for the audience to have little initial understanding of the spacial geography of the scene. They could have easily shown us a scene with her walking into the [gas-filled town with the motorcycle in frame, or have a shot of the entire battlefield as she charges the machine gun](#spoiler). The movie is so much more choppy and campy without these.
2. Too many unconnected cuts between tightly framed shots, especially in the fight scenes. This further plays into the problem of the audience not getting a sense of spacial geometry. It also takes away the impact of the fight when we can't dwell on the consequence of a hit or shot. They try to remedy this by having a horribly obvious CGI Wonder Woman do at least one cool move in a wide shot every battle.
3. Those three side-kicks show up, add extra movie run-time, act 1-dimensional, and provide little to the story. What the three side-kicks largely to play into was the theme that subjugation and war is bad and that men can be good and/or bad and people should try to be good. There are better, less messy ways to do this. Which leads into:
4. The plot contradicts the theme/thesis. Theme: Men are both good and evil but can make choices to better themselves (or make selfish choices that cause war). Plot: [I killed Ares, now war is over because he personified hate. They even red herring-ed have a philosophically consistent movie with the first ""Ares"" dying and nothing changing! What the heck.](#spoiler)
5. The biggest sin of all: there is no tension for the rest of the movie. We know how WWI ends. The allies are gonna win. In the opening scene I assumed the hot guy in the super old photo was dead, so him dying in the past is no big deal. Even if you care about him living, you know he's going to survive to at least the final battle because he's one of only two characters in this movie that you actually get to know. You never worry for Wonder Woman. You're shown early on that she's essentially bullet proof.

It's like two different movies, and the first bit is blinding people to just how bad the rest of it really was.

The stats they are highlighting don't lead to a conclusion that women are being actively discriminated against. 

Some highlights:

>Of the 3,933 short film directors at 10 top worldwide festivals,
a full 68 percent were males and 32 percent were females.

This is no where near equal but the numbers themselves show nothing. Unless we know the reasons for this large disparity we have no idea if this is sexism or not. The vast majority of NBA players are male. Is this sexism? (I realize this is an absurd comparison but it illustrates how numbers don't tell you the why)

The rest of the data seems to be based on volunteer response, which is statistically dubious at the best of times, but I'll take the numbers are face value and look at the reason presented for the disparity in the order listed:

>Work/family balance (64%). Participants stated that the tasks associated with their careers are made more difficult by familial responsibilities. 

This is choice - Not sexism

>Finance (61%). Interviewees mentioned that project financing was difficult

This is true for men also - Not sexism

>Subject matter, cast, or crew of films (29%). Women described difficulty generating finance or interest in films about females or individuals from underrepresented groups

This is interesting. It implies that the producers feel there is more risk in movies about females. If they are wrong this is sexism on their part (if producers are overwhelmingly male). If they are correct it speaks to people not wanting to watch movies about females. This feels like sexism. But, half the population are women. That large a segment of the population could make any movie profitable if they so chose, but choose not to (for unknown reasons). Unless we are considering women discriminating against female characters as sexism this is not.

>Three additional barriers were mentioned by female participants. The first was that the entertainment industry favors males (25%). Women also stated that non-gender specific closed networks (14%) in the industry make it difficult to gain access to opportunities for work or funding. Finally, individuals cited stereotyping (14%) or obstacles that arose from being challenged, dismissed, pigeonholed into certain types of content, or limiting norms or beliefs about gender

Since this is self reported data, this is all fairly useless. Because a women feels the entertainment industry favors men doesn't mean it's true. 

The real numbers that will make your case are raw numbers about how many people make films each year. And how many want to and can't get funding. Comparing genders within this data set may show discrimination. 

The reason I find discrimination at most partly responsible for the 2.13:1 ratio is that films are incredibly cheap to make right now. Nothing is stopping a women from being the next Kevin Smith. ",itsmehobnob

I enjoyed them a lot, and I'll eventually see them but it's just bullshit to me that here we are, almost ten years since Iron Man came out, and there's been another Spider-Man film, three Iron Mans, three Thors, two Avengers, AntMan(fucking AntMan), three Captain Americas, two GotG, Dr. strange, and a Hulk movie.
 So sure BW shows up and does her thing sometimes but they don't even bother to give her a solo spin-off and barely give her any merchandise. GotG has Gamora and while I like her and BW they're both sexy assassins turned good, please for God's sake just give me a woman on screen who isn't just a love interest or just a femme fatale.

It's bullshit we had to wait so long for them to bother with a woman headliner. It's bullshit that Wasp has to wait for a second Ant Man movie to show up (and share the film with him), and Panther has to wait to show up 10 years into the MCU. Captain Marvel, the first solo film, isn't happening until 2019...  

They planned 17+ movies before deciding oh, maybe​ we should make one (just fucking ONE) starring a non-white dude or a woman. It never should have happened that way. They bypassed bigger names/more important characters to churn out other films. They could have given BW a movie or made Morales Spider-Man in this universe (and considering we've now had 3 versions of Parker in film, I think that would have been cool), or done any number of things to add some diversity to their line...but they chose not to at all. Since that's how much they care about women/diversity, that's how much I care about giving them my money. They can wait until 2019. ",Blazemuffins

Gender is never relevant unless we are talking about clear differences between them, like in sports etc. Intellect is not one of them last I checked. SO anyone boasting about gender when something is achieved is clearly implying that the gender is somewhat inferior in that particular area.

This trend, in itself, is nothing new. These two points you just made are completely true. 

But I have two issues with it, that stem from this evolution: First, if on one hand this tuning makes this kind of cinema more palatable, it does so only in relative terms since blockbusters have VERY limited creative space. So saying they are better movies in itself doesn't mean too much, I'd say it's the least execs could do, and that's a reflection of the conservative nature of mainstream.

Second point is, this tuning acts these days as a legitimization of the co-opted art form. I can't see anyone arguing for the artistic or aesthetic merits of, say, Magnum P.I.. Why? Because it was clear what it was meant to be from the start. 

We now face a generation of people that are guided to believe that the new era of tv shows and cinema summer treats are legitimate deluxe art depictions. All execs did was saciate people appetite for better content by reassuring their old habits were adequate, instead of intrinsically making the content people were starting to get into.
It has then not been, in my opinion, a evolution of cinema but a natural evolution of mainstream trends.",raw_image

I don't think she was bad in that movie, but she came off as a bit airheaded and combat-obsessed.  I couldn't really assess a personality out of her.

Batman is still batman.

Flash loses his sense of morality.

Green Lantern gets turned into a yellow lantern.

When I first heard of the movie, I thought it would be a fantasy story where she goes on an adventure and slays a bunch of shit with her team.  You can imagine how thrown off I was... yet I went with it. I understood the underlying theme.

To be honest - I don't think the director of any one of the Marvel movies has that much free reign in what they want to do in terms of the plot, individuals shots, or creative aspects. If anything, their influence is most important in the performances of individual actors.

Directors in the MCU are there because they can manager film sets properly, not because of the artistic merit of their skills. Whedon certainly had the rep to be able to do that, as Dollhouse and Buffy clearly showed that he could handle complex film sets, action pieces, etc.",corduroyblack

> Prologue is dumb

>It doesn't even fucking add anything

> It's singular goal was to flesh out Batgirl so she appears to be less of a prop in the original story

> Manages to make her even worse than an object



>The adaptation of the comic is also bad

> It takes out the little details that fill Moore's work with Nuance and interest

> Remarkably bad transitions between present and flashbacks

>dull sepia filter for past that lacks the nuance of the originals artwork that was composed like a memory where seemingly random things pop like smells and bright colors

>takes out the nuance of the final confrontation by making it a boring punchfight

>takes out the the whole hall of mirrors scene whyyyy



>Also genrally bad animation


I'd say it's worse than War because the Justice League Origins comic was more or less the same thing and the movie didn't haphazardly ruin a great work.

Realistically the ice cream scene didn't necessarily have to be there either as her little walk to the baby played the same role of showing her out of depth with the world. But while jarring I wasn't looking to see if every detail makes sense and I can't give you a comment on that until a Director's cut is released as those scenes can be the first to go when a studio is trying to cut down on time which has been a big criticism for them in the past. I watched it in 3D so it was actually kind of hard to pick out too many of the background details since the perspective forces you to focus into more specific points.
2. This is a sin of the modern era of action movie fight scenes especially with larger groups. It has been pretty annoying to me especially with the slow-down then speed up mechanic since I usually find it boring. I think of this though as a sin of the rating system. As PG-13, they literally can't show those consequences since the studio isn't brave enough to release gorey rated R superhero movies. Personally, I'd argue gorey should be PG-13 and the cleaner stuff should be Rated R to show people real consequences in life. :P
3. Honestly preferred less backstory on them. Would've been fine if they weren't there and I really didn't want to know too much about them. Issue was creating characters without copying Captain America too much and unfortunately further development means more parallels are possible. Actually an issue with shifting her story to WW1 instead of WW2. Some of the WW2 based heroes would've been cool or an homage, but I like having complete focus on the main characters since the Marvel movies have kind of gone the whole route of making the cast too big and unwieldly.
4. I agree it was a cop out, but in terms of what could've been done, it was a tough choice. Had she let Ares live, now there would've been comparisons that a woman can't kill her enemy since both Batman and Superman have already killed in this universe. Probably would've been better to keep Ares out of it and in the shadows tbh, but I don't think they were looking for a sequel in WW2 for her. I just took it as now that Ares is gone, at least men won't have his whispering in the back of their minds. Though, it does kind of explain why she doesn't take an active role between the movie and the modern era. Like a subtle disappointment that even without Ares it's all happening again.
5. Another issue with shifting the timeline back to WW1 as opposed to WW2. It's a problem many of these comic book people have in terms of timelines. I honestly didn't expect him to go out that way. Figured it'd be old age and that'd be the reason she left the spotlight. But, I'll argue back to Captain America. Didn't feel any tension there either. Same sins with a different package.

I agree with your points. They're valid. This movie isn't a cinematographic masterpiece. It's a story that's entertaining within the comic book genre. You don't have to have the perfect movie to enjoy it. For me it's a solid B. I went into the movie thinking I'll be skeptical and I came out afterwards having fun. That's a lot better than I've been feeling with the Marvel movies.

> The biggest sin of all: there is no tension for the rest of the movie. We know how WWII ends. The allies are gonna win. In the opening scene I assumed the hot guy in the super old photo was dead, so him dying in the past is no big deal. Even if you care about him living, you know he's going to survive to at least the final battle because he's one of only two characters in this movie that you actually get to know. You never worry for Wonder Woman. You're shown early on that she's essentially bullet proof.

I won't bother defending it.

But outside of Doomsday (which is obviously CG, and I honestly couldn't imagine them doing a version that didn't look it), BvS's FX were pretty great.  The end fight scene was epic.

Wonder Woman's FX mostly stood out during the green screen on the island.  It was AWFUL (especially the little Diana falling scene).  Also, the CG double for WW was pretty iffy when it was switched in. And lastly, some of the lasso physics just weren't right.

Like I said...I loved the movie.  But I won't pretend it was perfect.   Hell, Return of the King (extended cut) is my favorite movie of all time....and it also features some of the worst CG I have EVER seen in a modern movie (the whole intro with Smegal/Deagal.....Pippin being lifted onto the horse by Gandalf....)

He knew the world wasn't ready to handle the realization of alien life, but more importantly he knew that Clark wasn't ready himself to deal with the world's reaction. He knew his son would eventually be found out, he says so in the movie. He just made it a point to tell him to keep it a secret until he's sure of himself and able to shoulder the burden. It was a more realistic, protective father approach to the character that I feel people blow out of proportion. The end of MoS even has a nice scene where Ma Kent says that Clark's father always knew how he would turn out (or something like that) and it shows him looking lovingly at Clark as a child while he pretends to be a superhero. I think Pa Kent knew Clark's heart and knew he would be good, but he also knew how important for Clark to develop into that person and be strong and sure enough to shoulder the weight of the world as it lashes out, worships, and analyzes his every action. 

I have my fair share of dceu problems, but I liked this take on the kents just as much as the original take. It's different, and not as overly optimistic, but it rings true to me as legitimate feelings parents would have about a child they knew would be something great one day, but also knew he wasn't ready for yet.

I don't believe that I suggested that. 

> And why is it automatically sexist or anti-feminist to not like the idea of swapping the genders?

I certainly didn't say that, but I would want to know why the simple idea of a gender-swap is so automatically disagreeable, especially since such venerable things as Shakespearean productions have experimented with gender, race, historical period, setting, and many many other factors down through the centuries without compromising the material. 

That said, I think that you've got to be turning a deliberately blind eye to the tone and content of the original posts that started the outrage. There were definitely a *large* contingent of posters that weren't just upset because they were making some generic change the the franchise; they were pissed that it was specifically changing them into women. Given that this was during the height of the whole Gamergate blowup and during the Sad Puppies attempt to derail the Hugos, it's impossible not to believe that a huge chunk of that reaction was coming from MRW types that were attacking *anything* that looked like it could be even theoretically construed as feminist for the sin *of* being feminist. As such, I don't think that most of those qualified as artistic arguments; I think that they were predicated on an ideological argument.

As to your specific scenario: one of my favorite movies is The Wiz which (if you aren't familiar with it) was basically a reimagining of The Wizard of Oz done with black actors. As such, when (not if) I hear that some movie that I have fond memories of is getting some kind of makeover, my reaction is always to wait and see how the damned movie actually turns out before I start putting on cognitive filters to judge it before I've even seen it.

Mind you, I fully expect for Sturgeon's Law to always apply so I do *expect* to be disappointed by most remakes, but not because they may or may not be tweaking the formula. ",anrwlias

Well, I basically agree about its success, but if you are looking at the movie as being a bellwether moment then I think it does matter. 

The movie is only indicative of a trend insofar as these same girl power viewers will continue to show up for other similar films. Which in truth isn't necessarily far-fetched, but it isn't really ""organic"" either.

For example, if you look at the ghostbusters debacle, a lot of people accused men of hating on the movie to torpedo it. Similar complaints were made about Amy Schumer's comedy special getting abysmal ratings. Usually some version of misogyny was blamed.

It's [pretty well documented in psychological literature](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/201205/the-triggers-sexual-desire-men-vs-women). That link is literally the first one that came up on Google. It's not even remotely controversial to say that. Men also have, on average, increased geo-spatial reasoning than women as a result of that (e.g. rotating imaginary 3D objects in your head, etc.) You are correct that there is variability among humans of both genders, but on average, far more men are going to have the aptitude and desire to be a film director than women will. There are definitely women who are great at it, like Katheryn Bigelow, but it's expected that there will be less of them. It has nothing to do with discrimination. 

> And even if we're talking about averages, the thing about them is that there are always outliers.

Not only is the choreography incredible, but it is shot so that you SEE the work.  There are often 5-8 moves per shot.  It is not edited to pieces so that the action becomes incomprehensible, and therefor meaningless.

I arrived at the theater at 10p Pacific after finishing off two 32oz beers and an order of boneless wings and chips. As I approached the windowI realized I had downed the equivalent of 2 liters of beer in about an hour, and felt awesome. I was seeing the movie by myself as it's a Monday night and it's the Baywatch movie, but I go to movies alone from time to time...no biggy. I enter the labyrinth into the auditorium and see 3 other moviegoers  (they were asian, 2 guys and 1 girl from what I could tell but that has nothing to do with much of anything). The film is set to start at 10:05 and I think there may be a few stragglers coming in later...nobody else did. 

The movie opens very strong with one of the first jokes being a dick joke from The Rock. Fuck yes! It's on and the momentum didn't stop there. From the first interaction with The Rock and Effron, I was actually laughing out loud. 

There was a Judd Apatow vibe to the film (ala running one liners in Knocked Up where they rip on the bearded guy and Funny People where they rip on the Swedish guy) with the Effron jabs. There were a metric fuckton of them, but somehow didn't seem overused or worn out.

The playful ribbing at the lifeguard profession and tongue in cheek humor helped show the movie didn't take itself too serious. This coupled with the sometime ridiculous plot points helped it just be a fun movie. I do have to mention that one of the Asians did take his phone out halfway through and start playing a basketball shooting phone game for about 5 minutes and caught up on some texting  (or maybe sexting...there was a lot of focus on tits in the movie). 

As the credits rolled and after the in credit outtakes finished I thought to myself how I haven't laughed this much in a movie in a while.  Having seen Wonder Woman 2 days ago I can say I had way more fun in this movie but wouldn't say it was a better movie. 

Long and short : Baywatch was a fucking funny film. Will watch again on Netflix/Hulu/Amazon whenever it drops. Would I pay to rent it or buy it? No, but if it was gifted to me I wouldn't kick the gifter out of my birthday party. ",Tower_Of_Rabble

Dolby Cinema is a package deal of the best visual and audio systems that exist, in my opinion (though I am partial to 70mm). 

The video portion is provided by two Dolby Vision capable laser projectors. Dolby Vision is a video standard in the vein of HDR10, but technologically superior in every aspect. Large color gamut (12-bit), infinite contrast (very deep blacks), high peak brightness (mastered to 4,000 nits right now, up to 10,000). Dynamic metadata. The current projectors are very good, but the standard supports even better ones.

The audio portion is Dolby Atmos, which is a surround sound setup that incorporates overhead speakers. I believe the audio is lossless, and it also incorporates a metadata system to adjust the output based on the systems' performance. More important for a home theater setup.

I think most Dolby Cinemas are 2D at the moment, but they do support 3D. I saw Rogue One 4 times, 2x in Dolby, 1x in IMAX, and 1x in a normal theater. I much preferred the 2D Dolby Cinema to the 3D IMAX, and I generally enjoy 3D. The screens are much brighter, partly because you're not wearing glasses, and partly because the projectors are better. To be fair, though, I think the newer, top-tier IMAX theaters are more competitive. Most ""IMAX"" screens are not the top-tier experience though - I think they need to work on their branding.

This was rambly, but let me know if you have any questions.",lordcheeto

They're downvoting you because almost everything you said in that post is bollocks.

Aquaman, I'll give you. I think that's more or less true. Mort Weisinger said as much, IIRC.

Superman isn't a rip-off of Gladiator. There were a number of inspirations. John Carter as was mentioned, but more that the 30s had two huge cultural impacts, i.e. the ""strongman"" or ""muscleman"" fad and well as discussions in philosophy and literature of the ubermensch or ""Super Man."" Not to mention Hercules, Samson and other heroes in history. Simon and Schuster admitted to all of the above as influences. The one they specifically disclaimed was the one you mentioned, Gladiator.

Bill Finger, who was responsible for much more of the Batman than Bob Kane (who really only came up with the name), was inspired by the Phantom, not Zorro.

Wonder Woman a ""rip off"" of the Amazons? I ... guess, but then all superheroes are ""rip offs"" of the Greek (and other) gods who inspired their creation. William Moulton Marston was actually inspired more by two things: the women's suffrage movement and the Varga Girl centerfolds in *Esquire.*

Cyborg wasn't a rip off of Deathlock so much as George Perez's desire to create an urban African American teen hero and inspired by the Six Million Dollar Man.

Barry ""The Flash"" Allen was inspired by Jay Garrick, the WW2 hero of the same name. And Garrick was obviously inspired by the Greek god Hermes (Mercury to the Romans). Quicksilver, who first appeared in the X-men as a member of the villainous Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, was another in a long-line of super-speedster characters, most of which were inspired by the Flash and/or Mercury/Hermes, but hard to draw a direct line from Flash to Quicksilver.

Marvel had like what, 5 or so individual hero movies before they did the Avengers? We spent so much time getting to know those characters that when the team-up movie came along years later we were pumped for it. DC did man of steel and then immediately did a team up movie next (BvS is definitely a team up movie despite the title). 

That's probably a huge part of the reason why BvS felt so overstuffed. They had to introduce Batman and Wonder Woman AND still have room to continue Superman's story AND introduce Lex Luthor. I didn't really care that much about Wonder Woman's part in that movie until I saw (and loved) her movie. And now when I go back and watch her part in Batman vs Superman I get pumped up.

I felt like he was woefully miscast (though I do love that actor), but I guess that's part of the reason why it took me by surprise...

And I suppose there had to be something to distract Diana that only she could fight so Steve was in a position where he had no choice but to sacrifice himself. Ares was a tool to accomplish the REAL plot: Diana's emotional arc. And I could've made peace with that *(especially if his end had been a bit more ambiguous - ""It's too late! I've transcended beyond the physical realm thanks to the mankind's violence! You'll only slow me down."" Something like that.)*

No... I think the real failures were the secondary villains. I feel like the Ludendorff needed more moments of development so I could get more satisfaction in his death or dread or hatred or literally any emotion when he dances with Diana or something. But as much as I enjoyed that actor in AHS, Christoph Waltz he is not.

And Dr. Poison felt so weasely and... I dunno. Weak. When Ares confronted Diana with her and tried to tempt her into killing her, I felt nothing. I felt like the audience should at least feel as tempted as Diana to ""see that bitch gone"" but I just felt sorry for her or nothing for her the whole time.

I mean, the movie seemed really well-received. And plenty more people that didn't see it in the theater may have seen it since, so perhaps a sequel would outperform Fury Road. But I don't know if they'd be willing to take that risk.

Isn't that what the two groups mainly consisted of? What percentage of the public was on the side that 99% of the media took?

>I certainly didn't say that, but I would want to know why the simple idea of a gender-swap is so automatically disagreeable, especially since such venerable things as Shakespearean productions have experimented with gender, race, historical period, setting, and many many other factors down through the centuries without compromising the material.

1. Because Shakespeare doesn't have the same broad reach as a blockbuster franchise, it doesn't have the same sentimentality/nostalgia attached.

2. I may be wrong but aren't most of those gender swaps you're talking about actually the actors playing different genders and the characters staying the same? I know there's a big history of women playing men and visa versa, but afaik the character's gender usually remains?

3. Changing the race is not the same as changing the gender. Black and white men are more alike than white men and white women. A gender change is an automatic drastic change, a racial change can be but doesn't have to be. They're still able to play the character the same way where a gender switch cannot.

4. Like I said before, it's not just a gender-swap, it's a big change to a beloved franchise and that's never a welcomed thing. Imagine if Harry Potter was remade and Ron had black hair, or Harry didn't have glasses, or Hermione was replaced with a guy. That would almost certainly be doomed to flop before it even finished production.



>That said, I think that you've got to be turning a deliberately blind eye to the tone and content of the original posts that started the outrage. There were definitely a large contingent of posters that weren't just upset because they were making some generic change the franchise; they were pissed that it was specifically changing them into women.

Yeah, because that was the drastic change? Of course they're not going to be complaining about 'generic change' when there's a specific drastic change in front of them? They're gonna go full blast on that point. IMO there'd be a big reaction to any drastic change, and actual misogyny didn't play near as much of a part as claimed.

>Given that this was during the height of the whole Gamergate blowup and during the Sad Puppies attempt to derail the Hugos, it's impossible not to believe that a huge chunk of that reaction was coming from MRW types that were attacking anything that looked like it could be even theoretically construed as feminist for the sin of being feminist. As such, I don't think that most of those qualified as artistic arguments; I think that they were predicated on an ideological argument.

Ghostbusters came out last year, gamergate happened in 2014. Gamergate is alive today in a similar state as last year. By 'MRW' I'm gonna assume you mean MRA? And seeing all the things the Ghostbusters director said and the articles he wrote about how ""men aren't funny"", I don't it's that strange to be put off by his brand of feminism.

>As to your specific scenario: one of my favorite movies is The Wiz which (if you aren't familiar with it) was basically a reimagining of The Wizard of Oz done with black actors. As such, when (not if) I hear that some movie that I have fond memories of is getting some kind of makeover, my reaction is always to wait and see how the damned movie actually turns out before I start putting on cognitive filters to judge it before I've even seen it.

You'd genuinely be happy to wait and see how Mellisa McCarthy did as a lead in a remake of an all black cast film? You wouldn't utter a single criticism before seeing it?

Well, I did ask for a citation, so I can't deny that you gave me what I asked for. I have to say that the current reproducibility crisis in psychology and the fact that major journals, including Psychology Today, have been doing a crap job of peer review doesn't leave me with a strong sense of confidence in their conclusions.

I did skim through the paper cited (it's a twelve part series so you'll excuse me from not giving it a detailed reading, yet) and it's basically a regurgitation of A Billion Wicked Thoughts: What the World's Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire.

Hollywood execs are women too. Are they being sexist?

Execs are in the business of making money. They are choosing the people who have the best chance of this. They aren't going to choose a man over a woman (or a woman over a man) with billions of dollars on the line without good reason. They'd allow a martian to make a movie if it would make them money. 

Do you imagine male execs have some cross company agenda to prevent women from making movies? That's absurd. If there was a talented director of any race, religion, gender, etc they'd be competing with each other to hire this person. Looking at stats and automatically crying sexism doesn't actually help a problem. And I agree it's a problem. ",itsmehobnob

Superman/Gladiator - These two are much more alike than you are letting on, even if someone specifically said they didn't copy Gladiator, they still have way too many similarities to ignore. [Here's more info](http://benny-drinnon.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-gladiator-and-superman.html)

Batman - I was able to find the article I had seen previously where Phantom was said to be a big influence on Batman. I mis-remembered it as a Timely/Marvel and I am still unable to figure out who published it. Zorro and Sherlock Holmes are still considered important inspirations for Batman, despite you saying otherwise.

Wonder Woman - This is not a unique character. That is all I am saying. One of DC's poster children is cut almost right out of mythology.

Cyborg again is a copy and past Deathlok and if you're unable to see that, I don't know what to say. If you change the race of Deathlok to African American, the art styles are almost identical. Not to mention they have practically the same abilities.

The Flash - I put him as the only original character in the justice league core team as his abilities and title, while legacy, were still first done in comics by someone called the Flash. This differs from Wonder Woman who is literally a Demigoddess of the Greek Mythos. Barry Allen and Jay Garrick both received their powers, though not 'original' powers, through a lab experiment and has no connections to Hermes.

Justice League has a rip off character(Aquaman to Namor), three HEAVILY influenced characters in Superman, Batman, and Cyborg, a Greek Demigoddess in Wonder Woman which is unoriginal, and then you have a Barry Allen carrying the mantle of The Flash, which was the first speedster in comics. So at least DC established this character first.

Examples of more original characters in comics that actually deserve any praise they get:

Human Torch, Taskmaster, The Chief (Though he is inspired by Mycroft, he would later heavily influence Charles Xavier), Silver Surfer, Spiderman, Martian Manhunter, hell even Green Lantern is more unique than every other character on the list for the Core Justice League team.",VThePeople

The Peter principle is a concept in management theory formulated by Laurence J. Peter and published in 1969. It states that the selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and ""managers rise to the level of their incompetence"".

I don't think I have.  I think you're trying to rescue some scrap of meaning from a steaming pile of badly written horseshit.  There's nothing to understand, it's just philosophically confused garbage writing that doesn't know what it's trying to accomplish.

>For me, that's what makes him a true hero, he wants to help out of his innate goodness, not out of a sense of duty.

Yeah, see, that's completely backwards.  It's far more heroic to do the right thing because it's the right thing to do, than to do the right thing because it also happens to be the thing you want to do.  There's nothing heroic about doing good when doing good makes you happy.  True heroism is doing good when doing good doesn't serve your own selfish interest.

Also, what the fuck Superman movie did you watch?  Superman isn't saving people and doing the right thing out of kindness and the goodness of his heart!  He looks *miserable* all the times he's saving people.  He acts like saving people is a chore -- and a chore he doesn't enjoy at all.

And that's the problem with Snyder's Superman.  He makes this big deal that Superman isn't under any obligation to help people, makes it clear that Superman doesn't get anything out of helping people (not even happiness), which begs the question: Why is Superman helping people?

That question is **never answered**, because Snyder doesn't know how to answer it.  His Superman ends up burdened by his moral duty, which Snyder has made clear *doesn't exist*.  So it's completely nonsensical, and it turns Superman into Stupidman.  

If Snyder had established that Superman had a moral duty to use his powers to save people and that Clark Kent did not want the burden of those powers, but accepted the burden -- even at the cost of his actual desires -- then that would make Superman a paragon of moral duty, which would make Superman heroic in the general sense.

If Snyder had established that Superman had no moral duty to use his powers to save people but that Clark Kent happily devoted himself to helping people out of genuine kindness and benevolence -- then that would make Superman a paragon of selfless virtue, which would make Superman heroic in the general sense.

Instead, Snyder established that Superman has no moral obligation to humanity, and no desire to be kind or generous with his powers, and yet use his power to help humanity for no apparent reason, then that makes Superman a dope, a moron, an idiot who is wasting his time doing something he neither enjoys nor has any moral obligation to do.

That's the exact opposite of who Superman is *supposed* to be -- the guy who fully embraces his moral obligations and who finds happiness and contentment in doing the right thing because it is the right thing.

Sure there are. In fact, it REQUIRES use of ""ambiguous language to conceal the truth or to avoid committing oneself; prevarication"" to arrive at such a preposterous idea in the first place. Mankind's hero mythologies have been about MEN doing those sorts of things, because that's men's place in society. The ultimate male hero is the one who can do the manliest things, aka Heracles, etc. That's the reality of sexual dymorphism in humans. There have been examples of women doing that sort of thing here and there throughout history but they are the exceptions that prove the rule, not destroy it. The myths about women do not revolve around great feats of strength. Occasionally, you have a story about speed or dexterity, but even those are relatively rare, because that is not what pre-industrial societies needed from women, so there is no need to mythologize that behavior. 

And you can laugh at red pill being nonsense all you want. At least it's not post-modern nihilist bullshit like feminism. At least it hasn't lead to the ACTUAL oppression and deaths of millions. So you can laugh yourself right back into the Stone Age along with all those fucking retarded Evergreen protesters. The sane among us will be over here if you ever stop acting retarded. ",None

Women have the same capacity, however historically the field of (successful and unsuccessful) directing has been overwhelmingly dominated by men. That is why it's noteworthy when a woman director has such a successful movie. This is because having successful figures of one's own gender makes them more relatable, and makes young people more likely to be inspired by them. It also shows some Film studios that may have been sexist that films directed by women can be extremely successful in the box office. 

The fact that I had to explain this to you step by step shows you don't know shit about the world. Your clear projection shows you obviously have problems you need to work on.

I was going into it expecting like...at least an 8, and there's a chance that the movie was only bad, and not horrible, but since I was expecting an 8, and got a 0, my brain thought of it as a -8, and maaaybe I'm judging it to harshly.

Like how I hyped up the amazingness of an Edgar Wright Ant-Man, was expecting some fantastic Hank Pym weird science, or a straight-up 100% heist movie set in MCU(like how IM2 was a buddy cop MCU movie), and didn't get any of those things, and am unreasonably harsh on that movie. 

I have biases. So I'm trying to correct em, hence ""sort of"".


EDIT: Fuck all the previous numbers. It's a -2. It was an entire movie based around the plot that Amanda Waller, who's in the top3 for deviousness and planning in the DCU, was clever enough to say ""I'll make it so *this* magic statue will explode if I push a button"", but was also stupid enough to say ""That magic statue? The one that looks like the statue that explodes that's linked to a magic so-and-so? There's no way that this statue is also magic. I should save money by NOT making that statue explode"".

The novel wasn't exactly that popular at the time and both Siegel and Schuster denied that it influenced them.

Batman: I know Bob Kane claimed that Zorro was an inspiration for the Batman, but Kane had so little to do with the Batman other than the name, it's hard to credit it as an influence. Bill Finger contributed much more to the foundational traits of the character. Was it an inspiration? Probably, but Batman is no more a ""rip-off"" of Zorro than he is of the Shadow or the Phantom or the Spider or half a dozen other heavily-cloaked adventurers with a night-based motif.

Cyborg, now that I think about it, I do remember George Perez saying that the visual of the half-human/half-robot face was inspired by Rich Buckler's Deathlok, so I'll give you that. But as a character, Perez basically was seeking a super-powered teen version of Jim Brown and Perez came up with the cybernetic enhancements first and only afterward came up with the visuals. You've got to distinguish between ""inspiration"" and ""rip-off."" Writers and artists get inspiration from all kinds of different sources. That doesn't mean their creations are necessarily ""rip-offs.""

As for Wonder Woman, again, there's a difference between ""inspiration"" and ""rip-off."" Was Diana inspired by the Greek gods? Well, of course. It's part of her origin. But to say she's a rip-off is just silly.

I totally agree with you and /u/PM_Me_PS_Store_Codes  Every time people call this a feminist piece of cinema, I just look at them like they're crazy.  Like, were we watching the same movie?  Literally everything Diana does in the second and third acts is dictated by or in response to a man.  She's hunting Ares (a man), getting guided around by Steve (a man).  She doesn't seem to have any problem whatsoever with the fact that women have to wear constraining clothing, aren't allowed in meetings, and aren't fighting on the battlefront.  There are only two other women in the second half of the movie, one of which is the butt of jokes and the other of which is blindly loyal to a man.  (Oh, and we know she's evil because she's ugly.  Because that's feminist.)  And don't even get me started about the love conquers all thing.  When she quotes Steve at Ares, I was so, so pissed.  Like Steve has taught her more than her bad ass mother and her aunt?!  If she'd quoted one of them, like ""I believe in myself because I'm stronger than I think,"" it would have reinforced matriarchal systems of power.  

Is WW better than lots of other movies in terms of feminism?  Yes, resoundingly.  Am I beyond thrilled that there's a movie with a female lead and a female director that's doing great?  ABSOLUTELY.

I agree with this. I just watched Batman v Superman again for the first time in over a year because I was so hyped about Wonder Woman. And Cavill's Superman looks physically pained in every rescue scene not involving Lois Lane. He looks uncomfortable and sometimes moves so slowly it seems he is still deciding if he's going to rescue anyone or not. He never even talks to people!

I liked Man of Steel ok but that movie established him as someone who could go years without helping people. Then when he does act heroically, he contributes to a ton of destruction starting in his own home town. Even in BvS he seems to have regret because he's feeling unappreciated (until Lois perks him up), not because a ton of people died (significant contrast with Superman II). It's like he feels no connection to anyone on any level except his mother and Lois Lane.

The future vision where he is basically destroying the world over losing Lois Lane fits this version of Superman, but not the altruistic good guy version of Superman.",None

Superman and Gladiator similarities: 
--------

The exact metaphor used eight years prior for Gladiator is used to describe Superman's powers in his very first comic.

Both have super strength, speed, and bulletproof skin. When Superman was first released, he was unable to fly. But just like Gladiator, he is able to jump really high in place of the flight he would get later on.

--------
Batman and Phantom Similarities
--------

Both are considered Legacy Heroes in the sense that the Batman or Phantom mantles aren't just tied to the individual, similar to The Flash. 

Both witnessed at least their father's murder by gangsters/pirates and this lead them to become a superhero.

Both have cave lairs, with Batman having the Bat Cave and Phantom with the Skull Cave.

Both carried pistols (Batman originally had one.) and used that to fight crime. But not only that, they both are supposed to never kill, but they both killed people in their early adaptations.

Finally, both characters feature a 'bad mark' used to warn other criminals, based on the theme of their cave. Phantom has a Skull Ring and Batman has his Bat Spotlight.

--------
Cyborg and Deathlok Similarities:
--------

Both characters are Cyborgs which leads to them having similar Energy-Based attacks, [interestingly they both have the ability to teleport?](http://www.superherovs.com/en/deathlok-vs-cyborg-powers/comparison-1414-1103-4) They also look nearly identical, from the placement of cybernetics (right arm and left face) to the odd fact that they both have brown eyes. (I also thought Deathlok was African American. His skin looks really dark in a lot of the art, but I'm pretty sure he is Caucasian in lore.)

Both are Americans and they both received their cybernetics after death/nearly dying and thus received their cybernetics unwillingly which leads to both characters struggling to remain 'human'.

Interestingly enough, both characters were pushed to commit terrorism, though Cyborg ends up rejecting his old friend and battles him whereas Deathlok does try to assassinate the president but is stopped. 

--------
Wonder Woman and Greek Mythology
--------

Wonder Woman is where I think we won't find much common ground. This is due to my own bias in that I never liked when the comic books would have characters like Zeus or Hercules. These are characters of Homer, being used for profit. That being said, I will point out all the similarities between WW and other greek heroes to show just how unoriginal she is.

Diana is a Demigod, something very common for heroes of the Greek Mythos. This would be fine if it didn't mean that the Greek Gods do exist in the DC Universe with Diana being the daughter of the Amazonian Queen named in Greek Mythology. This is just generic. If they would have at least used a different name for her mother, this would be a lot better.

All of her 'core' people are Greek Gods, which leads to more generic genericness as she received the blessings of all the Gods and Goddesses. She was essentially created just to further feminism, which at the time was important and I support that shit 100% don't let me mislead you on that one, but now she is just an OP feminist with no real 'thing' that makes her unique.

Wonder Woman, while designed for a good purpose, is woefully generic in her new adaptations and lost a lot of what made her character unique, such as being formed from Clay, was thousands of years old, and is the reincarnated soul of an unborn baby who's mother was the first woman ever murdered. That's a much more creative story than an OP 25 year old demigod in heels.

--------
TL:DR
--------
Superman is pretty much just John Carter mixed with Gladiator with an added level of 'poster child armor'.

Batman - We have accepted that Bob Kane's original idea was inspired by Zorro, then Bill Finger would later be influenced by Phantom.

Cyborg - Cyborg does feature a unique backstory, and I am a fan of his character (Teen Titans 4 Lyfe), but his abilities and his overall appearance is too similar to Deathlok for my liking. Especially the right arm and left side of the face thing. When comic books are just as much about the cool combat as it is developing the characters, same with all action movies/books/whatever, it takes away that this character isn't really unique.

Wonder Woman - I admitted that I have bias against taking characters out of Mythology, and I have acknowledged her design intent. This does not mean I have agreed that her character is unique, nor one of a kind at her present state. ",VThePeople

There's a video someone made on  youtube that disects the claim that all the comments on youtube were sexist. Something like less than 5% were crude and sexist in nature, most were valid complaints about the film. 

The whole thing was contrived, hell there's a video Paul Fieg made that was literally about how ""men aren't funny"" and how women are the real funny ones and guy humor is nothing other than dick and fart jokes.

Why would Siegel and Schuster lie about Gladiator not being an influence? Might it not be the case that both characters draw inspiration from a common influence, i.e. John Carter, Hercules or, as Siegel and Schuster stated, from the various ""strongmen"" and wrestlers of the day? 

Similarly, Bob Kane created very little of what we now know as the Batman. Bill Finger embellished Bob Kane's ""Batman"" character, giving him his costume, city, weapons, car, etc. So, should we listen to Bob Kane, who says Batman was inspired by Zorro? Or Bill Finger, who drew inspiration from the Phantom?

Another is that you're using later developments in the history of these characters in an attempt to support your hypothesis. As but two examples: (1) originally, Wonder Woman was not a ""demigod."" Though her origin has varied over the years, it's only of recent vintage that her father was introduced at all, much less that she is the child of one of the Greek gods; and (2) Cyborg's ability to teleport was only when his origin was revamped to make him part of the Justice League. He did not have that power as a member of the Teen Titans. You say that they had ""similar"" energy-based attacks. They did not. Cyborg has his white sound blaster, an attachment to his arm. Deathlok used a pistol (although a futuristic, energy-based one). The original Deathlok, Luther Manning, was Caucasian, by the way, although a later version was African American. Again, yes, George Perez said he was inspired by Deathlok's look when designing Cyborg, but other than being cyborgs, they have little if anything else in common.

I am far from the most knowledgeable comic book historian around, but I feel pretty secure in stating that my analysis is much more grounded in actual fact than your suppositions.

Lastly, I have no desire to argue this further, but you continue to conflate the terms ""inspire"" and ""rip-off,"" although you do not continue to use the latter term. What's an ""original"" character? Hercules, Hermes, and Hades are obvious influences on Superman, Flash, and Batman. The Romans borrowed their gods from the Greeks who borrowed from the Sumerians and other Mesopotamian cultures. Look at the similarities between Hercules and Gilgamesh, for example. 

If you want to make your argument more compelling, you're going to have to do your research. As it stands, you're forming conclusions based on incomplete and inaccurate information.",SKIP_2mylou

I thought the title was Dr. Strange: Fate. Nope. Dr. Strangefate... Fml) but I also think there is miscommunication with my analysis.

------
Here are places we agree:
------

Namor and Aquaman.

Superman and John Carter influences.

Batman and Phantom influences.

Cyborg and Deathlok Weapon differences (I admit I was wrong. [this image] lead me to believe that he had Iron Man like blasters in the hands and the website I linked has 'Blast Power' listed as his first ability. This is incorrect and I want to correct the record. I also did not know it was a 'sonic' weapon, not an 'energy' weapon.)

------
Where we disagree:
------

Superman and Gladiator - I won't be able to convince you otherwise, but I have found another source making the same [claim](http://www.popmatters.com/feature/184221-secret-origin-of-the-superhero-on-philip-wylies-gladiator/)

Batman and Zorro - Batman was originally influenced by Zorro, Bob Kane has stated this, but I am not saying his comic-book adaptation is grounded in his original concept. It would be ridiculous to say that Zorro had a bigger impact than Phantom as the similarities between Phantom and Batman are uncanny.

Wonder Woman - I did comment that her origin has changed into what it is now, she's been rebooted half a dozen times with drastically different origins each time, but her original concept was just an Amazonian Warrior, this would be much more acceptable than to draw from the actual Greek Mythology that she has today.

Cyborg and Deathlok - They are nearly identical in appearance, they both are American, and they both received their cybernetics after they were either killed or severely hurt (Cyborg would have died without the cybernetics, Deathlok is made from a dead body). And they were created only 6 years apart and funny enough, Cyborg was the name of Deathlok's original comic book.

When I use the term rip-off I am referring to the relationship characters have with their counterparts from the rival company. Two amazing examples are Deadpool and Deathstroke or Namor and Aquaman. Maybe rip off isn't the right term, but you /know/ what I am implying. These characters are so heavily influenced that what little uniqueness they have, is shadowed by the fact that they are imperfect clones of another established character.

------
Examples of what I mean by Rip-Off:
------

Hawkeye and Green Arrow

Redhood and Winter Soldier

Swamp-Thing and Man-Thing

Elongated Man and Mr. Fantastic

Red Tornado and Vision

Cat Woman and Black Cat

The list goes on... I know I haven't been around the comic industry long and I mix up minor details (A sonic cannon vs an energy cannon) but it's hard to dispute the similarities. Phantom and Batman are nearly identical in their purpose, background, and ability set. ",VThePeople

Uh, no. GA was created first, but he was hardly the only archery-based hero around. Also, Hawkeye was a villain when introduced. And, ever heard of this guy called Robin Hood? GA was created basically as Batman with a bow and arrow.
 
> Redhood and Winter Soldier

This one, I don't know the circumstances. Would have to research.

> Swamp-Thing and Man-Thing

Again, more like two creators (who were friends, by the way) taking inspiration from the same source, i.e.  The Heap, created in the 40s. The two muck monsters debuted only two months apart. This one was just a coincidence. 

> Elongated Man and Mr. Fantastic

Again, this is more like both characters taking their inspiration from the same source, i.e. Plastic Man, who debuted in the 40s, while Elongated Man was introduced in Flash in the 60s, shortly before the debut of the FF. 

> Red Tornado and Vision

Again, another remarkable coincidence. RT appeared only two months before the debut of the Vision.

> Cat Woman and Black Cat

This is another example of post hoc ergo propter hoc on your part. In 1979, Marv Wolfman was looking for a new villain for Spider-Man. He decided to base his creation off of an old Tex Avery cartoon called ""Bad Luck Blackie"". Bad Luck Blackie was a black cat that brought misfortune to anyone that was close in proximity. Black Cat's low cut, tight leather costume with claws in her gloves certainly sounds a lot like Catwoman... the *current* version of Catwoman, that is. 

But in 1979, Catwoman was a whip-wielding, purple and green costumed super-villain whose claim to fame was committing cat-inspired crimes. It wasn't until Frank Miller revamped Catwoman in 1987 that she became the leather-clad cat burglar we know today.

So, again, do your research. I think you will find fewer cases of ""rip-off"" characters than you suppose.",SKIP_2mylou

You're talking about their creation, I'm saying the characters themselves are not unique and thus DC does not DESERVE to have successful movies only because of their characters, this is because none of the characters in Justice League are unique. They are heavily inspired and so close that it ruins any uniqueness they have.

I'll give you examples from out of comics to explain further, look at Starcraft and Warhammer 40k. I know Blizzard was going to make a 40k game originally, but that doesn't mean that their Terrans should look nearly identical to the already established Space Marines. This goes on with Zerg and Tyranids, as well as Protoss and Eldar.

If you were to say, ""Blizzard deserves to have Starcraft sell well because they have such unique characters."" I would point out the one that came first and show how it was so influenced that it's less art and more copying.

It's very interesting that so many 'unique' characters with very bizarre abilities are so similar and were released around the same time. 

I also realize that I should have pointed out that those names were in no particular order and that is my fault for the confusion, i.e. I didn't say GA is a copy of Hawkeye, but it be very hard to call Hawkeye unique if DC, your rival company, already has a generic Robin Hood character.

GA might as well be Robin Hood for how heavily influenced you can see he is. So why does GA deserve credit for being unique, if you can so obviously point out that Robin Hood inspired him almost to a T?",VThePeople

Wonder Woman is their only movie rated above 55% on RT. In BvS, one of the few almost unanimously agreed upon things was that Affleck's Batman was actually pretty good. A movie based on that was announced shortly after, but that probably wont be done until 2019.

* **Thor: Ragnarok** - Many were wondering just how big of a chunk Justice League would take out of Thor: Ragnarok this weekend so you might be surprised that despite the underperformance of JL, Thor still dropped 61.8% this weekend to come in at #3 with $21.7M. That puts it in the same range as Thor: The Dark World which dropped 61.2% on its third weekend against a major opener The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. It's clear that despite social media saying the opposite most people who decided to skip Justice League just stayed home or saw something else, they did not all go see Thor: Ragnarok instead.

**Notable films closings**

* **The Snowman** -  We seem to have a trio of one-time hyped but ultimately terribly reviewed and performing films closing this week. First up is The Snowman which closed to a weak $6.6M domestic and $37.2M worldwide on a budget of $35M. The murder mystery film which was originally to be directed by Martin Scorsese was rushed into production when he left the film, causing the director Tomas Alfredson only enough time to shoot 80% of the script. Critics agreed with the director that the film made no sense as it received some of the worst reviews of the year though it did make enough overseas in European countries to not be a total disaster, just mostly one. 

* **Suburbicon** - It seems an A-list star and director don't salvage a terribly reviewed film either as the George Clooney directed/Matt Damon starring 1950s crime thriller closed to a pitiful $5.7M domestic and $6.4M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film seemed poised to be a solid hit but quickly word got out about the film's messy take on race mixed with it's 1980s written Coen Brother script and the film ended up having the worst wide release opening in Paramount's history. It didn't help any the film got the second worst grade possible from Cinemascore, a D- and it quickly exited theaters with a whimper. 

* **Tulip Fever** - In what might be the last The Weinstein Company major release the much delayed period piece erotic drama closed to a terrible $2.4M domestic and $7.8M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film, which has been in some stage of development since 2004, was shot in 2014 and screened at Cannes in 2015 but received such terrible reviews and during the worst of TWC's money troubles that it was reshuffled 4 times over two years before finally being released with no promotion and grossing barely anything. Right after release the major story of Harvey Weinstein's decades of sexual harassment came out forcing TWC to fire Weinstein and with lawsuits forming daily could easily mean this will be the last major Weinstein release ever. What a terrible yet perfect film to end the long slowly dying outdated and awful distributor. Frankly, I won't miss you.

Warner's disasterous and awful Snyderverse was on life support and if this doesn't get WB to pull the plug on this garbage universe then they're nuts.

Time to *Flashpoint* and start over. Key will be bringing in someone that actually gets the characters and can make movies that are smart. No one hated the Snyderverse because it was dark they hated it because it was, as someone else put it, a universe that seemed conceived by a 14 year old edgelord and Ayn Rand fanatic. DC didn't need to make a comedy they needed to make a fun movie. Nolan movies were dark and serious, but fun and real. Snyder movies were dark and shitty. The cheesey CGI city scenes and barren landscapes where battles happened looked like something out of a bad 90s video game. Nolan changed the superhero genre as much as Marvel did and then DC decided to revert. Schumaker Batman films were campy and visually cheesy and campy. The Snyderverse feels like that but without joy.

As someone who loves DC, this was the best box office news. May *Justice League* make $5 million USD next weekend and be the flop of the century so this never happens again.

Marvel made a slew of solo films (off the top of my head I think it was 2 Iron Mans, Thor, and Captain America) before they went for the ensemble Avengers. Warner Brothers I believe screwed themselves by wanting to rush into an ensemble because they wanted the success of the Avengers immediately. Had they done a Superman, a Wonder Woman, and a Batman solo film before going for the Justice League movie, this could have been avoided. Plus this would have given them the opportunity to see what worked and what didn't work before the big team up movie. Batman vs Superman would have also been unnecessary, allowing Doomsday to have been better utilized and not wasted in a terrible way. 

Had it been me this is how I would have set up the universe:

1. Wonder Woman film (WW1, keep it, that's perfect)

2. Batman (Youngish Batman, ~2-5 yrs into his career having just taken down the crime families and first major villain faceoff against Deathstroke after a bounty)

3. Superman (Similar to Man of Steel, show him making himself known to the world)

4. Justice League (Batman finds Superman in order to find out about him, don't need them fighting that was stupid, Steppenwolf comes out, Wonder Woman makes herself known, just the Trinity team up but they realize they need more for Darkseid)

He was portrayed as he should have been on the silver screen but it's too late now. BvS messed up the DCEU big time. Because of the bad writing in that film, they lost two big opportunities of introducing Doomsday and death of superman in a much better fashion. Also if Zack was hell bent on portraying Supes in a dark manner, then this movie should have Supes going against JL. Or his revival should have been epic unlike the simple treatment that it got in the movie. In terms of villain, JL got measly Steppenwolf whereas BvS had Doomsday (and thus epic fight scenes). And the weird part is that Steppenwolf was proving to be a worthy adversary if there was no Superman. I was hoping that WW herself would be more than sufficient to finish him off but nope, that was not the case. But my biggest gripes are: why couldn't they put SM's death for later iterations? Why didn't we get the similar introduction of JL as the animated series? Would it be too similar to the first avengers? Also Jesse's casting as Lex has been a disaster of epic proportions.

There was a rich man who flaunted his wealth, and one day he bought himself a golden Buddha statue for his mansion to symbolise his affluence and status to the townspeople. A devote, but poor man saw this, and wished he had his own Buddha statue so he may better practice his faith. However, he was poor, and could not even afford the simplest statue. Thus he dug up a old tree stump from the woods, and out of it, carved a statue of the Buddha himself. He created a shrine for the statue, and every day he left half of his food rations in front of it as an offering. 


Hearing of the poor man’s actions, the rich man felt he was being emulated, and thus challenged. In a fit of rage, he sent his goons to smash the poor man’s statue. The devote man was easily overpowered, but to his surprise, the statue came alive and beat back the man with strength. His faith, the statue explained, gave it power to move and speak and fight. 


The rich man was of course surprised to hear this, but he quickly deduced that if the poor man’s humble statue carved it of a tree stump can accomplish this amazing feat, then his golden Buddha must be capable of much more. He challenged the poor man to a most unusual match: their two statues will wrestle, and should the poor man’s win, he will be left alone for the rest of his life.

The faithful man was worried and scared, convinced his precious Buddha will be destroyed after all. However, the statue told him not to worry, and accept the challenge. On the day of the match, the two men carried their statues to a makeshift arena in front of the whole town. Upon setting down the golden Buddha, the rich man was pleased to see it become animate, and walk, if somewhat unsteadily, towards its opponent. The wooden statue strode to meet it with confidence, and the two wrestled. The battle was short and one sided, soon the wooden statue picked the golden one up, and slammed in into the ground. The gold Buddha trembled and struggled, but could not get up. The rich man was humiliated, angry and confused, he walked up to his statue and demanded to know the reason for its defeat. With a shaky voice, the golden statue spoke:


“Though my opponent is a mere wooden statue carved out of a rotten tree stump, he is basked in pure faith every day. He is worshipped at his shrine, pampered with daily cleaning and offerings of food, however unrefined it may be. I, on the other hand, was but a status symbol you purchased in worship of yourself. I have not been looked after since you installed me publicly, until yesterday I was covered in dust and you have never given me even a bowl of rice as offering. I am sick and weak compared to him, of course I lost.” And with that, the golden Buddha crumpled into dust.


The moral of the story is that get yourself a Buddha statue at home, cos they are like fucking Pokemon.",hemareddit

Problem is, rather than stop and reposition, they waited too long and attempted a 180° course correction in mid-stride while sprinting in one direction. Resulting in an embarrassing faceplant, but, again, at least they ended up with their face on the asphalt in the right direction.

The DCEU is probably going to be scaled back to individual movies that might crossover in the future but for now will be entirely stand alone. Wonder Woman will get a sequel, the Aquaman movie is done, Batman will obviously get a movie (though it's questionable if Affleck will do it now), and Whedon's Batgirl will happen. All the rest are probably going on the shelf for a while.",fullforce098

And the thing is, THEY ARE DOING THAT. Heck, Geoff Johns is now one of the people running the DCEU. Wonder Woman was a good start, but that was partly because of Patty Jenkins. It was too late to truly change Justice League, though, even with Geoff Johns and the late substitution of Joss Whedon. Add in the damage the BvS did (which in itself is what caused this shift, although again too late to save JL), and, well...

We'll truly be able to see if the DCEU can turn itself around with Aquaman and Shazam!, I guess. What is a bummer is that they've basically wasted Ben Affleck's Batman stint given how he's basically said he'll be out fairly soon- might not even make it to his solo flick (My guess is that they'll use *Flashpoint* to pseudo-reboot the whole thing to introduce a new actor).

Nowadays, even many casual moviegoers and people who do not read comic books know the differences between DC and Marvel. They do not know all the details of DC or Marvel, but they have some general ideas of DC and Marvel are different ""universes"". People know Superman and Batman belong to one universe, (i.e., DC,) while Ironman, Captain America, Thor and the Spider-man belong to a different universe, (Marvel). People know those two groups of superheroes do not share the same universe. People have an idea that those two universes are two different franchises that do not cross over, like McDonald vs Burger King.

Unfortunately for Warner Bros, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad have damaged the DC brand. That is the problem with DCEU: due to people's bad experience with and distaste for Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, are actively avoiding seeing another DC movie *unless it receives very good reviews,* (like Wonder Woman.) DC fans are going to watch DCEU movies regardless, but they by themselves are not enough to sustain a big-budget franchise. The masses are avoiding DCEU due to negative brand perception.

He has zero cognitive issues, it’s all physical limitations.

More than anything, this opening is a reminder that A) BvS wasn't just divisive, people HATED it and it damaged the brand badly and B) keeping Snyder rather than delaying post-BvS doomed this thing from the start.

1. I went and saw JL this weekend, and forgetting about the movie for a second, I paid to sit in a premium theater since (1) I didn't want to have to get there really early and wait in line to try and get a decent seat, and (2) typically when you pay more you get less riff-raff. Well, I was sorely mistaken about #2. There was this parent behind me who brought their 8-year-old and all he did was want to talk the entire fucking time. I didn't pay to listen to your kid talk lady, so you need to shut him the fuck up or don't bring him to the movie. 

2. The cost is getting ridiculous when I have just a good of a set up in my house for picture and sound. At this point, I'm ok waiting a few months for it to come out on Bluray or digital and spend $25 on that instead of $25-$40 on tickets to sit in a theater. Plus I can enjoy it from the comfort of my house, pause it when my wife or I need a bathroom break, and not have to take out a small loan to afford concessions. I can't imagine taking 2 or 3 kids to the movies these days. that's an easy $100.

I know this is going to get downvoted to oblivion because everyone hates the DC movies here, but I loved Justice League. It was far better than BVS and SS and I'll probably see it a few more times before I get around to Star Wars and the 10+ times of seeing that. Justice League reminded me a lot of the first Avengers movie in many ways. And the reveal at the end made me more giddy and fanboy-ish than anything Marvel has done so far except for maybe the first reveal of Thanos. It had a lot of heart. I think the problem is that people are expecting it to be as far along as Marvel at this point even though they have a 10+ year lead on them.

Also, to anyone saying they need to reboot the franchise, they don't have the time to do that. How much longer do you think the Superhero bubble will last? I bet after Infinity War part 2 it's game over. DC needs to get everything out by then, they have a deadline on the horizon. Either that or they need to hedge their bets on there still being a desire in audiences after the MCU comes to it's conclusion and they can step in to fill the void, but I don't think that will happen. I think audiences will start to move on. They need to just tough it out with this franchise and get out what they can while there is still time to do it.

I was cheesin and had a few good laughs I wasn’t expecting. Overall I enjoyed JL but simultaneously I felt pandered to with the cheesy tone change. Like I get they were building to a more hopeful universe but that progression should taken more time. The cheesy hope speeches and Batman doing a complete 180 felt cheap as hell. Flash gave me some laughs but it was sooo forced and awkward at points. Basically the movie and the universe feels rushed and that’s what ultimately gunna put the nail in the coffin for this whole thing. And it’s a shame because Zack’s visual style and how he brings to life superhero action is AMAZING. The sound design and the feel of a lot of these fights are so nerdgasmly awesome that it’s a shame most of the stuff surrounding it feels like a sinking ship. 

I could even forgive all that but what singlehandedly killed this movie was THE RESHOOTS. It was PAINFULLY obvious how many scenes were reshot cuz they were all shot with a close up. Just talking heads in front of a green screen I mean COME ON! The Clarke/Louis scene in the cornfield. Looked like complete shit. And then to bounce back in forth between Snyder’s meticulous visual style to the tv show asthetic was just so awkward lol. ",bruce_leeroi

There's a right way to do this and a wrong way and DC gambled on the popularity of the world's two biggest superheroes to carry them through and it just didn't work.

IT was a bit weak and when you have Batman in a movie you are going to have to do very well to bore me as I fucking love Bats.

such a shame- i work in the film and TV industry and I see this everyday on set. The Director will shoot a scene and the producer will pipe up saying lets try it another way as ive heard that this particular thing is popular right now. Its making movies by numbers with 10 people's vision instead of one singular vision on how it is supposed to go.

So much source material to choose from and so many ways to go and they chose the way of the toilet.

They need to crush the next Batman movie- I would like to see something along the lines of the arkham Origins game if they are having Deathstroke as the main baddie. Maybe there is a bounty out on batman and there are a bunch of assassins after him; maybe Deathstroke is killing his way through Gotham and Bats is suing his superb detective skills to find him- kinda like a superhero version of Se7en

I feel so stupid in saying this...but stop spending hundreds of millions on films and this will stop being a problem.

I'm gonna talk about JL without seeing it, so excuse me if this sounds weird - but I'm not gonna go see a justice league movie because of who they cast to play the characters. I want to see the characters. If I'm thinking about who is playing the character, then the idea behind the film is flawed from the start.

It could have been all nobodies, but if they got the performances right, I probably would be more inclined to go, over my opinion that I don't want to see Affleck as Batman. And don't try and tell me there isn't a mile long line of actors willing to play those roles for far less than who they cast who could have done an equal job at a minimum.

Its biggest downfall is that it's 10 years behind the MCU. If this had came out the same year as The Avengers I think it would have done so much better, with the same audiences being drawn to two multi-superhero movies even if for a comparison.

It set on the path of creating a true Superman, and didn't get bogged down on origin stories for the other League members. There was a great showcase of abilities and I'm actually looking forward to seeing the solo movies now. It didn't need a memorable villain as it set the groundwork for mother boxes and the New Gods, as well as the Green Lantern Corps.

Man of Steel needed a sequel to create that worldwide worship of Superman before rolling into BvS. That and BvS itself is what hurt the DCEU.

Also, those credit scenes were easily better than 90% of any the MCU has churned out.

They can't do anything about Wonder Woman 2, Aquaman, or the new Batman movie as stated. They are far into production or planning to just outright cancel them. But it would not surprise me if massive changes are made (in terms of re-writes) to get them going into something much different with the endings.

They need to get rid of Snyder (if they haven't already), find someone in a Kevin Feige mold to run this superhero division like a well-oiled machine, and figure a way out of this hole. Cause as of right now you have some of the biggest names in fiction not making a splash because of previous mistakes. You really have no one to blame but yourselves even though, I'm sure, the head executives will blame others.

I know there are a lot of apologists and fanboys on here. And I am a DC fanboy as they come, but even I know this has been a failure of titanic proportions.

Sadly, despite the general quality of the movies (because they are pretty good quality movies, I have never seen Superman punch that hard before) the tone didn't sit right with the audiences and like every hivemind that goes into things, people started hating on DC while praising Marvel when we know that both have issues and strong points to each movie.

I remember watching a video where they explained that the MCU was carefully planned and that after Iron Man, they are working slowly toward expanding the rooster while the DCU is more into rushing things and just wanting to release the Justice League Film.

I really like both movies, there isn't a single movie in the MCU that makes me feel the power and weight of every single punch in Man of Steel or BvS and on the contrast Marvel movies are always fun to watch but I have never felt that are any stakes at all after The Avengers.

Henry Cavill's delivery as superman... is the best that we have ever seen for Sups outside of animated series. He has the looks, the presentation, the delivery... but he just cannot get a decent script/director.

Even Batfleck.. some people hate him, but I  LOVE his Batman, I was never too fond of Bale's because he turned Batman into this sort of karate-finess focused hero...wheras Ben Afflecks is much more physical, and intimidating in a visual sense.

Wonder Woman - everyone had their doubts initially, but after 3 solid performances from her, everyone loves it.

Aquaman - a (IMO) bold move with the casting choice, in that when people think ""Aquaman"" they generally think ""lame, whitebread, boring"" not Khal fucking drogo. And he brings a lot of flair and interest to an otherwise underwhelming character, so I feel like people are really looking forward to more of this.

Cyborg - i feel this is the only thing, where it didnt matter at all who was cast... he is 99% cgi throughout the movie, and had terrible dialogue that I dont think anyone could have made a worthwhile performance with.

Flash - an interesting choice and direction for the character. I am not sure at all how most people feel about the character/portrayal... personally I was underwhelmed, but mostly because of terrible dialogue writing... he came off as borderline autistic, rather than a super brain who is just processing things on another level and struggles to relate.",Maestrosc

As disjointed as fuck in style and tone due to the number of cooks, but not bad. But that doesn’t mean it was good, because it wasn’t. It’s just the second out of five DCCU movies that I actually wouldn’t mind watching again.

If you’d told me a month ago that I’d actually feel pity for DC/WB over another one of their misguided attempts to make a superhero movie failing I’d call you a liar and break things off with your mom, but here we are. For the second time they actually make the kind of film they should have been making all along and they get nothing for it. Which either means they won’t try again or will enforce a Marvel level edict of “be like Wonder Woman no matter what the subject matter” which is as bad as them trying to make everything like Batman.

And before anyone starts quoting numbers for Man of Steel or Batman v. Superman remember: It’s about expectations. Batman made a billion dollars by himself under Nolan. Combining Batman with Superman and Wonder Woman should have broken the billion-dollar mark without trying but didn’t. And now you have a film with Batman, the new star of Warner Brothers, Wonder Woman, Superman and the main character of a successful TV show and it’s still failing!?! The reason is simple: Snyder. He’s never understood the material and based on how both he and his wife blame the audience, will never understand the material and they frankly may have damaged the characters so much when people see them, they have no interest based on what’s come before that’s a bit sad since the DCCU is clearly ready to leave that style and tone behind.

But part of me thinks they deserve this. Superman is the simplest character on earth to get right. Not making him a bright and shining character is like making a movie where Sherlock Holmes isn’t smart then blaming the audience for not getting your “interpretation.” No one wants to see a character called Sherlock Holmes where he’s not the smartest guy in the room. He can be a nice guy, he can be a dick, he can be a drug addict or his biggest addiction can be his violin; he can be in turn-of-the-century London, modern day London or even New York City, but he always has to be the smartest guy in the room. But this escaped Snyder and the WB execs that gave him money…twice and now they’re literally paying for it. Justice League cost $250M+ and again, didn’t open bigger than the two lowest grossing Marvel characters. And with Pixar, Star Wars and nonstop Oscar bait coming over the hill it won’t have a chance to recover.

And I’m gonna be honest. Part of saves this film for me is it’s the closest approximation to Superman they’ve gotten so far (something I hear echoed by non-comics civilians). They knew it too. I mean, it fucking opens with a retcon showing a smiling Superman who shakes the hand of firemen and is kind to children, which never happened! As comic book geeks we’re more than familiar with this, but you have to wonder how a regular person who’s just seen Batman v. Superman where half the world hated him and Batman wanted him dead is now being told the world worshipped him and Batman is desperate to bring back. But it kind of derails the film a bit that the second act is all about bringing him back. Though when they do, he’s a guy who is single-handedly more powerful than all the others combined (I could endlessly watch the moment when The Flash thinks he’s moving too fast to be seen and Superman—-while holding off Wonder Woman, Aquaman & Cyborg—- has zero problem seeing him). But again, while it’s great watching him basically single-handedly whup Steppenwolf’s ass, it diminishes the team given the majority has been about how much the rest have struggled to defeat him. That honestly should have been when Darkseid shows up to be someone it does take the entire team to defeat. It is after all called “Justice League” not “Superman & The Justice League.” Not to mention it makes any use of Darkseid in the future redundant because what’s he going to do that Steppenwolf hasn’t already done? He’s not going to be their Thanos and it’s not like it’s loose end to anyone but a comics fan. To the average person Steppenwolf was the sole bad guy.

The idea that The Flash movie will be “Flashpoint” where they reboot it all to formally distance themselves from the Snyder era is more likely now than ever before.",None

That being said I'm tired of the movies not living up to their potential. These are some of the most famous superheroes of all time. Much more popular than many of the Marvel heroes before the MCU ever were. I want to see more of my favorite heroes but that will only happen if the movies improve and bring home the money.

I'm no expert. i can't sit here and type a full on revival plan or anything. Just hope that we can finally see something change and get better (what's this, 3rd time saying that?).

With Thor: Ragnarok set for a massive opening,the best for the franchise so far, it comes as no surprise that it’s getting, well, electrifying reviews. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn has already heaped praise on it and in a new television spot, film critics can’t

The Hollywood Reporter called it “a majestic spectacle,” while Entertainment Weekly deemed Taika Waititi’s threequel “a triumph.” Empire Magazine labeled it the “boldest Marvel film yet,” reinforcing the hype that the next chapter in the Odinson’s superhero life is getting thus far. The 30 second clip revolves around Thor assembling his Revengers — Valkyrie, Loki and of course, Hulk — to take on Hela as she seeks to destroy Asgard.
Also notable is that it’s more action-heavy and not focused on humor like previous ones we’ve seen so far. While the footage in this preview doesn’t include any new snippets, fans can see the epic shot of Thor in civilian garb calling down lightning via Mjolnir and immediately transforming into his warrior wear, as Odin and his successor remind the audience that “Asgard is not a place. It’s a people.”
Thor: Ragnarok opens on November 3rd, 2017. Ragnarok is already earning nearly universal praise from critics and stars Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Tom Hiddleston, Tessa Thompson, Jeff Goldblum, Idris Elba, and Karl Urban.",raviseeram

People don’t want to be belittled and talked down to constantly by millionaire hypocrites who turn out to be guilty of things far worse than what they’re prattling on about through social media.  We usually want to go to the movies to get away from all of this and simply be entertained for two hours and $50 of our hard earned cash.  

Hollywood has completely poisoned the well and the more truth that comes out, the level of that contamination becomes more and more evident and the more they will see people avoiding their industry.

JL didn't do well because the holiday weekend coming up.  It'll do just as well next week as this and the critics will be scratching their heads.

Wonder did well because they thought they were going to see Wonder Woman.  Buch of confused idiots out there...

Thor: looked to be meh.  Too gimmicky with the whole 80's thing.  I already saw season 2 of Stranger Things.

2. They need to let directors take control of most projects however, they need to be searching for great writers that understand these characters and can make a great script on a ""tighter"" budget.

relies on green screen with heavy emphasis on color correction to make a horrible looking picture. The whole trailer looks like their fighting on a rock planet and not earth.

I don’t doubt that DC still has super dedicated fans, but it’s crazy to see the quick shift in how quickly Marvel’s formally b-list characters are now the big shots. 

I agree with you on WW. The reason is succeeded is that it was glaringly unlike the rest of the DCU, with good characters and a good plot. It wasn’t rushing to a sequel, it told a story and people liked it. That’s what they need, good and engaging storytelling with well written characters in the mix, not making 15 spin offs hoping to speed along to a cash cow of another team up movie. ",skeletonpjs

A big part of that is leaving directors well alone. I mean, setting up an ensemble movie that is supposed to be the starting off point of your flagship DCEU and then, when 3 hours have been shot and edited, tell the director to shave off 1 hour for reasons, do not be surprised the audience has trouble caring about the characters or following the storyline (such as it was).

Snyder was trusted too much with Man of Steel and BVS and Ayer maybe not enough but it does not seem it was going to greatness. Who knows what really happened with Snyder leaving Justice League and how much the changes were neened.

What they need is some studio control before the production begins. Hire good directors ane writers (who care about comics) and competent producers and make sure the script is ready before filming.  Make sure that the big things like overarching plot for the film and the universe, characterization, characters in general, estimated runtime, and tone is agreed by all. Then let the director have control if things seem to be going smoothly.

I hate to bring up Marvel but that seems to be what they are kind of doing. It's not like always leads to greatness (and Lucasfilm also had had some issues with the approach) but you need some overall control while not ruining the film in post because you panic.",Chinoiserie91

The fact of the matter is this: if they keep making these movies and they eventually get some consistent good reviews (basically duplicating Wonder Woman’s reception), they can still turn it around. If a solo Superman or Batman movie comes out to rave reviews, audiences will go. Maybe not in all-time records like they hoped, but the money will be there. Never forget: Batman Begins had to clean up the mess of Batman & Robin. Look how quickly they turned that around.

Plus, I think what really hurt JL is they started immediately after B vs S, and had to deal with a ton of changes/alterations on the fly following the film’s reception. Even Suicide Squad had to change a bunch of things due to B vs S. Wonder Woman and Aquaman’s productions were the only two that just did their thing and tried to make a good movie.

But they're skipping over a lot of the set up that Marvel did with their solo films which actually invested audiences in the characters first. 

Warner Bros has a lot of potential with the individual DC heroes that they could build up with solo movies, but they keep chasing that Avengers payoff too early. Instead of taking a step back and seeing what worked so far and what hasn't, they keep plowing ahead with their ill-conceived plan for a franchise.

It's kind of sad when one of the common ideas I see suggested for the DCEU is to Flash-fuck the timeline so that they can fix the universe. It's only a handful of movies in, there shouldn't be so many problems with the shared universe that you need a reboot to fix it.",IsD_

Suicide Squad was not well received and a second film may get decimated just like BvS 2 (AKA JL) just did.

People are not completely stupid.  Even casual moviegoers and non-fans know at least a little about DC and Marvel.  DCEU has been putting out one bad movie after another, (i.e., Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Sucide Squad; Wonder Woman is the exception, not the rule, for DCEU movies.)  So people have learned to avoid DCEU movies *unless* the reviews for a movie are good, (e.g., Wonder Woman.)

>Just before Wonder Woman came out, I had already made up my mind that I was NOT going to see it - because Man of Steel was underwhelming, Batman v Superman sucked, and Suicide Squad sucked. I did NOT enjoy any of the previous DCEU movies, so why would I waste my time, money and energy to let another DCEU movie torment me? When a franchise repeatedly put out one product after another that sucked, a wise consumer learned to avoid everything from that franchise. That is just good common sense for being a smart consumers.
>
>Then, when Wonder Woman came out, it got raving reviews and over 90% at Rotten Tomatoes. Which convinced me to give the movie a chance. Just so you know: my original ""default"" position was I was NOT going to see Wonder Woman. I had already decided to avoid DCEU movies because, at that point, everything from that franchise (i.e., Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad) were either underwhelming or awful. When a company kept putting out one low-quality product after another, you avoid everything from that company.
>
>However, the Rotten Tomatoes review score convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance. Let's be clear here: if you take out the RT score from the equation, I would have just stuck to my ""default position"" and skipped Wonder Woman. The RT score convinced me to give the movie a chance. So DC fanboys should stop blaming reviews: I had watched the previous DCEU movies. They sucked. So I had made up my mind that I would avoid everything from that franchise. The RT scores was the only thing that convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance.
>
>It was the same situation with Justice League. One good movie (Wonder Woman) has not changed my overall negative feelings toward the DCEU franchise. I had already decided I was not going to see anymore DCEU movies - especially DCEU movies made by Zack Snyder - because I hated all of the previous DCEU movies made by Snyder. My ""default"" position was I was going to avoid Justice League - and all future DCEU movies.
>
>However, if Justice League had gotten a good score at Rotten Tomatoes, then I would have given the movie a chance. However, it did not. It got an awful score at RT. So I stuck to my original plan and skip the movie. In the future, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, I will stick to my ""default"" position: I will avoid DCEU movies.
>
>That is the predicament facing DCEU. I believe a lot of moviegoers are in the same position as I am. We watched the previous DCEU movies, and we hated them, so we had decided that we do not want to waste any more money and time on any more DCEU movie. So, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, we are just going to pass.

Let's be frank here. DCEU movies are simply not as good as MCU or X-Men movies.  Actuall, DCEU generally suck with only one exception, (i.e., Wonder Woman.)  Not all superhero movies are created equal.  People know the difference between DC and Marvel.  

Over the years, people have developed a brand loyalty towards Marvel and X-Men - because those two franchise have consistently put out good movies.  On the other hand, people are now actively avoiding DCEU movies because Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad have damaged the DC brand.   That is just a normal consumer behavior: people go back for more if they liked the previous products or services.  People stop going back if they got repeatedly burned by the previous products or services.  DCEU has developed a negative brand perception, and now Warner Bros is suffering the karma for putting out too many bad movies and only one good one in the franchise.

I mean that on both side of the political spectrum, honestly. Mel Gibson's somewhat shaky reputation with the left didn't doom Hacksaw Ridge to failure.

Second if going to see a movie costs you fifty fucking dollars you should damn well expect more from them than mindless chewing gum for the eyes. If they're truly that expensive you should be holding them to a higher standard. You should want them to to be deeper and engage with more meaningful subjects like politics and philosophy because there are far far far far cheaper options for easily digestible entertainment.",None

I mean you go back just 3 or 4 years and this situation would've been unbelievable. Because DC's characters overall were better known to the general public than Marvel's, IMO, if only because of a lot of kids in the 90's/00's grew up watching the various DC animated series. I bet you a lot more people were familiar with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash than they were with Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, and Thor. 

&nbsp;

Like when I heard that Marvel had Cap 3 going against BvS I thought they were out of their minds. Like there was no way it would stand a chance against a movie starring two of the biggest super heroes of all time. Now granted Cap 3 was more like Avengers 2.5 but still, DC ended up moving BvS and Civil War stuck with it's original release date and did way better because it was a better movie. 

&nbsp;

Now we had Thor 3 coming out so close to the JL, again something that I would've thought was a real bad move on Marvel's part a few years ago, just raking in cash while JL under performs. I mean this is the freaking JL man, it should've been printing money but instead it's barely floating. Like again, I'm willing to bet that before 2012, the JL was way better known than the Avengers. I remember plenty of people describing the Avengers as Marvel's JL, so to see this role reversal is pretty shocking. 

&nbsp;

IMO it's because DC/WB doesn't understand and respect what makes their characters special and likable and while Marvel does. Plus they don't seem willing to invest the time and effort to plan out these movies and have a path for their cinematic universe to follow. Basically they need to find a Kevin Feige. ",skippy130

Yep. I mean, if you just look at Superman's characterization and story arc in the DC Snyderverse alone, he's done massive damage. I mean, I'm impressed.

And this is the guy who did a pretty alright job with *Watchmen*. I mean, I don't remember him massively fucking up any of the character interpretations there in translating them to the screen. This took real effort.

Batman with Justice League was even more amazing. He took the dark, brooding loner character who is probably the most legally/morally questionable of the lot and turned him into the Reed Richards of the DC Cinematic Universe. Why? Because he buggered up Superman so badly he needed a heroic character to contrast and to assemble and keep the Justice League together, so he inadvertently flipped their roles and character traits.",FizzleMateriel

*Man of Steel* was disappointing, but *Batman v Superman* was even more so. I never watched the theatrical version of the latter though, just the extended version (which honestly wasn't *that* bad either - I just think the horrible miscasting of Lex Luthor severely hurt the film).

I agree that they should have changed direction after BvS flopped, but to say Snyder hasn't done anything impressive seems to be off, but that's just my opinion of course.

I agree about Wonder Woman being different and fresh. But I'd still be completely psyched to go to a good Batman movie. Superman is a tougher sell for me personally, just because I've never been a huge fan. But even then, good reviews would still get me in a theater to see it.

I suppose there being a 'deluge' of Batman and Superman movies/shows does make it a little easier to skip the mediocre/bad ones though.

It's just hard to get excited for mediocre movies. The Flash has been one of my favorite heroes since the Justice League cartoon, and I'm still really pissed that I'm not looking forward to seeing him on the big screen when I wanted just that for so long.",stryker101

In that regard, I think in spite of the alarming looking 61.8%, that drop could have been worse with a good JL movie, so JL tanking did help Thor.

Just before Wonder Woman came out, I had already made up my mind that I was NOT going to see it - because Man of Steel was underwhelming, Batman v Superman sucked, and Suicide Squad sucked.  I did NOT enjoy any of the previous DCEU movies, so why would I waste my time, money and energy to let another DCEU movie torment me?    When a  franchise repeatedly put out one product after another that sucked, a wise consumer learned to avoid everything from that franchise.  That is just common sense for being a consumers.

Then, when Wonder Woman came out, it got raving reviews and over 90% at Rotten Tomatoes.  Which convinced me  to give the movie a chance.  Just so you know: my original ""default"" position was I was NOT going to see Wonder Woman.  I had already decided to avoid DCEU movies because, at that point, everything from that franchise (i.e., Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad) were either underwhelming or awful.  When a company kept putting out one low-quality product after another, you avoid everything from that company - that is just good common sense.     

However, the Rotten Tomatoes review score convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance.  Let's be clear here: if you take out the RT score from the equation, I would have just stuck to my ""default position"" and skipped Wonder Woman.  The RT score convinced me to give the movie a chance.  So DC fanboys should stop blaming reviews: I had watched the previous DCEU movies.  They sucked.  So I had made up my mind that I would avoid everything from that franchise.   The RT scores was the only thing that convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance.

It was the same situation with Justice League.   One good movie (Wonder Woman) has not changed my overall negative feelings toward the DCEU franchise.   I had already decided I was not going to see anymore DCEU movies - especially DCEU movies made by Zack Snyder - because I hated all of the previous DCEU movies made by Snyder.  My ""default"" position was I was going to avoid Justice League - and all future DCEU movies.  

However, if Justice League had gotten a good score at Rotten Tomatoes, then I would have given the movie a chance.  However, it did not.  It got an awful score at RT. So I stuck to my original plan and skip the movie.   In the future, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, I will stick to my ""default"" position: I will avoid DCEU movies.

That is the predicament facing DCEU.  I believe a lot of moviegoers are in the same position as I am.  We watched the previous DCEU movies, and we hated them, so we had decided that we do not want to waste any more money and time on any more DCEU movie.  So, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, we are just going to pass.",None

One of the last of these movies I went to watch was Dr. Strange. Usually I go into these movies and get annoyed by the tone or some kind of execution with lazy writing or whatever. But this time watching Dr. Strange I just kinda let it go and accepted it as a movie made for kids. And I enjoyed it alot more for that.

That's not saying that the standards for these movies are any better or any worse for it. It's just a shifting of perspective. Like I'm not gonna go into Thor: Ragnarok with the same attitude as I did with the new Blade Runner. Just isn't gonna happen. So I just think of these movies as made for kids, and I end up enjoying them as an adult more for it.

If you're from a small town (like myself) and your theatre at best plays three, maybe four movies, then it just cuts into your options and availability.

And then you just start thinking about allocation of resources and funds. The studio dumped 300 million on this movie purportedly. They could've made several other potentially more interesting movies with that kind of money divided up. Movies that would've had alot less pressure to perform and thus would not have been tinkered all to hell and would inject some variety back into the cinemas instead of superhero movie #49.

Look, I get that There's an audience for these movies, we wouldn't be having this conversation if there wasn't. But enough is enough. Every time you turn around there's a new one coming out.

It actually has a lot working against it:

- Only one movie has ever made more than $100M in its OW in February, and that's Deadpool, a beloved comic book character that exceeded expectations. We've seen Black Panther in a movie before but he's definitely no Deadpool. I also don't doubt that the movie will be great, but the premise and the tone aren't the same as Deadpool either, so I don't know if that will necessarily be to its benefit, especially in a moth like February. Otherwise, February's been a trash site for shitty superhero movies before these last couple of years, so it's hard to really compare it to like Daredevil of Ghost Rider. 

- You could say the movie is comparable to Ant-Man, a character not at the same level of the zeitgeist as some of the other Marvel characters. Development on this seems much smoother and it'll probably be well-received, but it should be noted that Ant-Man, while having performed admirably, is still the MCU's second worst performer.

- And speaking of Ant-Man, look at the MCU's OWs. The only MCU films to make more than $100M in a weekend are sequels (presuming we're OK with lumping Spider-Man into that category). And, again, this is the first time Marvel's released a movie in February, which is not a really great movie month. Winter Soldier didn't break 100M because it came out in April, I have a hard time seeing a path to 100M for BP in February if you look at those trends.

- Worth noting also that while BP has a stacked cast, it doesn't really have anyone like Ryan Reynolds to be the face of it, which I think definitely helped Deadpool.

But, like trends are meant to be broken. People might be starved for action movies in Feb (the only stuff coming out action-wise before it in 2018 are that Cloverfield movie and a Liam Neesons movie as everything gets out of the way of Star Wars' long tail), Deadpool set a bar, Marvel's never released something in the winter and BP is the exact kind of unique and different movie that February might need, so who knows?",Prax150

Logan and the Nolan trilogy are the only real Dark Age successes (critically and commercially) and those had a point to their darkness that the DCEU doesn't.

That's precisely why Zack Snyder was the worst possible pick for this series of movies. Snyder is a huge Ayn Rand fan, and the fundamental tenet of Rand's philosophy is that you *don't ever* have a responsibility to help other people.

Whether or not one agrees with this stance, it's indisputable that it's almost instinctively repulsive to a lot of people. And I think this underlying tension has done a lot to make people turn against Snyder's Superman, even if they can't exactly articulate why. They see a Superman that goes through the superheroic motions of rescuing and saving people, but looks depressed about doing so and constantly questions whether he should quit (or maybe charge for his services ;-).

I liked both, but JLU was just the best shit. The multi-part story ""The Once and Future Thing"" is one of my favorite DC animated stories ever. They go to the past and team up with Jonah Hex, then go to an alternate future and team up with Terry McGinnis (Batman Beyond), Static, and the future Justice League. 

Plus, the storylines with Cadmus were great. I really have nothing bad to say about those shows; they were excellent. They even used the final episode of JLU to give a real, proper sendoff to Batman Beyond. ",Frostfright

Then you do Justice League. Then you do a handful of about 4-5 mini group movies, and start including the B-team heroes like Green Arrow, Black Canary, Supergirl in those movies. Then, you do Justice League 2 with Darkseid or Braniac whos been being hinted at in those 4-5 mini group movies. In that movie, we kill off basically everyone from the main members of the League, and set it up that our B-team whos been living in the League's shadow is gonna have to step up to the plate now. You do a movie or two of them struggling to deal with that. Then? You do Blackest Night. You get a great movie of the b-team coming into their own against Zombie Justice League (plus it will let you revive the big names). Now you have the headliners but youve also built up the b-team guys so youre not reliant on the DC Trinity for everything and can keep this shit going literally forever until the sun explodes or we hit super fatigue.

The insistence on sticking with him is baffling

Disregard quality of the film (big ask, but try) and put your studio exec hat on. 

* *Dawn of the Dead* violent R-rated movie that turned a 28 million dollar budget into $102mill. 
* *300* - a comic book adaptation. R-rated again (this is supposed to be a handy-cap). Turned $65mill into $456mill and massively popular online. ""Huge success!""
* *Watchmen* - a super-hero comic book adaptation. R-rated. Turned $120mill into $185mill. ""That's not amazing, but imagine if we give this guy a kid friendly franchise!""
* *Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole* $80mill into $140mill. ""Not bad for a property no-one has ever heard of before"" 

Ok, we're rebooting Superman. Nolan said he cbf anymore. Who do you give a tap on the head to? In 2011/2012. DC movies - outside of Batman - have largely been shit **and** made no money. Singer who did the last Superman is back making his X-Men. Green Lantern flopped. *V for Vendetta* did kinda okay so maybe the Wachowskis? Francis Lawrence did alright with *Constantine* but Snyder's resume in comparison reads better (especially if he can recapture the magic of *300*!). 

So they give him *Man of Steel* and, despite the mixed reviews, turns $200mill into almost $700mill. That's better than some Twilights, some Harry Potters and some Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?). 

You're going to give this guy the next film in your up-and-coming cinematic universe. He passed the test. 

Then BvS tanks. Snyder's fault? Was it too much too soon? Was it the tone? There's a lot of finger pointing and blame going on. 

You can fire the guy who's already in the middle of crafting you a universe, waste a lot of time (and therefore money) hoping your next talent is going to save the day. Or you can just *shift* the tone, keep tweaks and damage$ low, and hope the next one brings in the masses. 

He might be gone now, but it would have been a huuuuge call to fire him straight after BvS. It might have been the right call in the long run, but would have cost them some money. ",theBelatedLobster

Look, I understand that RT isn't the best metric for quality measurement but when your last four movies have had mixed reviews AT BEST and none are highly regarded by the majority of audiences that have seen them, there's something wrong. And it's not like people want only jokes dude. People want compelling stories. People would have LOVED BVS despite its dark tone if it had actually been well written and handled the characters well. Logan? Incredibly handled. You don't have to like the MCU movies but those movies are objectively more character driven and have better payoffs. People haven't resonated with this version of Superman, the most popular superhero in the world. There's something wrong. It's Zack Snyder. He's not a good director. David Fincher is a good director.

Not to mention it's much more likely those solo movies will be successful without controversial directors or WB meddling (assuming they'll handle these the same way they handled Wonder Woman - by trusting the director).

Aquaman's most likely gonna do well with James Wan behind it, Shazam seems somewhat promising and The Batman and WW2 are almost definitely safe with the people behind those. In the future we're even getting Nightwing with Chris McKay and Deathstroke from Gareth Evans. I'm feeling more optimistic for the future DCEU solo movies.",slicshuter

So maybe they shouldn't have made a big deal about being comic accurate if they were going to have Batman shoot at a car until it explodes and then drive through the flaming wreckage?",bluemew1234

The silly humor of it does not fit everyone and I have heard several people talk about how it was to silly to be enjoyable for them etc.

I thought it was great, but I can see where they are coming from. And as word of mouth spreads I guess there is a group of people that was waiting to see it that don't bother because of that.

Also, even though JL did poorly it still added to Thors drop.

Also, Thor had a pretty big opening so a bigger dropoff in % makes sense, over 20 million in its 3rd week is still decent. ",Barneyk

The whole movie picked up for me when the cape became a character...because even without any lines the cape was more interesting and had more personality than anyone else on set. I have tried watching valerian a few times now and stop within 15 minutes. I can't tell you why I just sort of lose interest and find myself doing something else pretty quick. It is funny when the ""Finding Francis"" episode of Nathan for You has been more creative, wit, and emotional than most movies I have seen in a long time.

They seem to have stopped doing this since Flash was supposed to come out in March and they cancelled that after losing three directors and starting a complete rewrite, but it's still what helped tank Suicide Squad. They had locked themselves down with the release date before bothering to higher a director, a writer, a single actor, etc.

The resume, as first sight, does read quite impressively but after MoS which really did get a lukewarm reception, obviously they should have considered new direction. After BvS the writing was on the wall and not canning him is simply denial.

But we also can't blame the director for the whole mess; ultimately the studio agreed the vision, tone and direction of the movies which has shown to be a big misstep. The writing has been consistently poor throughout. In this latest JL movie, just off the top of my head, they re-write the ending of BvS re the dirt rising from the coffin suggesting Superman is still alive and affirm his is dead, have a ridiculous resurrection scene (with some silly pseudo science thrown in about the Flash having to ignite a magical box before it touches the magic goo), thereby leaving the motherbox - which the JL are protecting with their lives apparently - in the middle of a carpark and they forget about it until the CGI monster booms in and picks it and then disappears again.

I would have had him save his dad from the tornado and then travel the world. The two of them not talking anymore because its a huge fight between them.

It's a fun movie. But how much credit can you really give the director for that? So much of the movie was just a shot for shot remake of the comic. Yes, I know people often complain about the stuff he changed, but the defining story of the movie should be how much was taken exactly from the comic. Many scenes had the exact same dialogue, and many scenes had even the same camera angles and shots. The movie was basically just taking Watchmen, chopping out large parts of it, making a few mostly inconsequential changes to the plot (for what it's worth, I don't even mind the changed ending! It was fine), and then recreate the comic book on screen.

For some, that's cool. It was like a condensed version of Watchmen came to life. And doing that competently is obviously not easy, any big budget movie is a major challenge. But Watchmen the movie is one of the least creative movies that I have ever seen, for better or worse. For many fans of the comic, it was pretty cool to see the scenes that we know and love exactly translated to live action. 

But Watchmen is the perfect example of a film living in the shadow of its source material. Because Watchmen was explicitly written for its graphic novel format. There are many parts that just... don't translate. I know it's cliche to say ""the book was better than the movie"" (and that's not *always* true, despite people applying it to everything), but this is kinda the perfect example of it, because the movie is just a faithful, lesser version of what we had in the comic book.

That got a bit off topic, but my point is that if Watchmen is one of Snyder's defining wrks, that's pretty worrisome. Because it was a competently made film, but it wasn't one that required much creative input. So much of the details in Watchmen were grabbed directly from the comic book. It's more of a translation than a new creation. So it's a fine way for a director to show competency, but it hardly shows that he's ready to be in charge of a superhero franchise.

Not that Snyder is necessarily the problem. I'm not really one to say, the premise of Justice League/BvS doesn't particularly appeal to me in the first place, so it's hard for me to judge. But I don't think Snyder should get *too* much credit for watchmen.",Ziddletwix

For instance, I think he'd probably make a very good Batman film.

But the problem for Snyder is, he seems incapable of making a film that ISN'T a Batman-style movie -- one that's steeped in darkness and gloom.  He is obsessed with making the other heroes ""fit"" into the Gotham-style backdrop, rather than viewing Batman as an outlier in the Justice League, which has ALWAYS been the understood characterization.  Even if you go back and watch ""Justice League Unlimited,"" Bruce Timm and company understood that Batman isn't always going to toe the line.

He's also said he thought The Fountainhead was a ""thesis on the creative process and what it means to create something.""

When you see how he admires Rand's works, it's a bit easier to notice how he inserts that kind of philosophy into the mythology of Superman. 

It all stems around how Supes was raised. When Pa Kent tells young Clark that he maybe should've let those kids drown instead of accidentally reveal to the world that he is exceptional, a ton of red flags went up in my mind. Pa Kent was basically telling Clark to act within rational self-interest, and that is absolutely core to Randian philosophy. Superman almost always only acts within his own self-interest in the Snyder universe, or at least he does in Man of Steel and Batman Vs. Superman. I haven't really thought about his character in Justice League yet.

I did manage to successfully skip Suicide Squad, but the reviews convinced me to check out Wonder Woman, and I'm glad I did. I've seen it twice now (watched it with the 'rents a few weeks ago), and I still adore it.

Could argue there wasn't much creative input by Snyder and he was working off an already-great piece of work, but look at many of the popular comic book movies these days and you'll realize character development isn't much of a thing at all. Or if there is, it's cliche beyond belief.

I imagine the WB producers/execs/whatever probably look at Snyder and say, ""Yeah, he sure can make a fight look cool,"" but if that's all you have going for you in a film, it ain't going to be great. His flops have all suffered for questionable plot and character development.

When he does all these things right, it's great. But his last several films haven't done that at all. I think he's trying to cram too much story into 2 hours, unfortunately. Not sure if that means it's 100% his fault, but as I said, I don't support him being involved in any more of the DCEU unless it's for a solo film perhaps. Would be interesting to see his take on a 'smaller' hero.",chefr89

And as others have previously explained with *300*, all the weird fantasy-lite elements in it (as well as the depiction of Xerxes, etc) make a lot more sense when you realize Dilios is telling a story (how the movie ends/begins). He narrates throughout it, making it like more like a story you would tell your buds around the fire or whatever, back in the olden times at least.

His thoughts and points are dumb.

He clearly doesn't understand superman, or batman really, and he seems to only be interested in making cool or visually appealing shots, he doesn't understand film making beyond the visual, he doesn't understand tension or stakes or even pacing, he doesn't even get that he's bad at these things. I've read a decent amount of quotes by him and a decent amount of interviews and snippets and the man is just not very smart.  The RLM review of suckerpunch has some choice lines and I agree with their assement that he's like a teenaged boy intellectually. 

 When I found out he liked Ayn Rand and wanted to make a Fountainhead movie I was like ""Yeah that sounds about right"". 

Some people just aren't all that smart. Every good artist, or plumber, or anything isn't a genius, film making is more than cinematography, and great directors and film makers are very intelligent, Snyder is not intelligent and fails at everything outside his specific niche. His best films are ones which very closely follow comicbooks to the point of almost perfectly matching scenes, when he doesn't have to write a plot or storyboard doesn't have to do character design or character motivation doesn't have to do anything but set up a nice looking shot he does great.

Eh, I can't remember who said it, but it was something like, ""there are a 100 guys in Hollywood that are better actors than Johnny Depp. You know what the differences is? He got a break.""

Sticking a ""bankable"" performer on a film seems to make almost no difference in whether or not a film is profitable. Why not cast an unknown who blows away the casting people vs a 20 million dollar gamble, especially in films like this, where it's the character that's more important than who plays him.

>And if your franchise is successful, which is what you are assuming it will be, they will be bogged down by other commitments.

Maybe, maybe not. You can always structure a contract, however, and for a no name, it will be for considerably less. Of course, if they then go out and become a better know star, you get them for peanuts. Of course, I can't see Hollywood every coming to the conclusion of trying something like this.

> yes, he absolutely 100% drummed up interest AND brought people to the movie that would have otherwise not gone.

Didn't work for Justice Leagure it seems. BatvsSuper didn't make more money than Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises, so under what metric are you using?

> Yes, you are going to pay a premium to actors to sign multi-picture deals. 

And it cost less to sign an unknown guy than a Ben Affleck.

>200+ million dollar movies are fine. There isn't anything inherently wrong with them at all. 

A movies budget has never been correlated to it being good, let alone the important aspect of profitable. I don't have a problem with whatever the budget is, but the idea that you need to spend more and more every single time is gonna start bankrupting companies trying to outspend one another with pie in the sky dreams of profits that are never gonna come.

I've said this elsewhere. With distribution models now being more open, I'd rather see 10 batman movies made by 10 directors, each given 10 million bucks. The odds of those 10 movies being able to recoup that 100 million are probably higher than putting all your eggs in one basket and than having it bomb like Justice League has. ",dtabitt

I was commenting on hype, especially pertaining to at the domestic box office and audiences.


Star Wars relies far more on motivated US audiences than the marvel machine, which can expect typically 10% more of their box office share to come from abroad.


Rogue One was a billion dollar movie, but it relied on 50% of its box office from domestic audiences.  Of the 4 marvel films grossing a billion dollars or more the highest domestic box office share is 41% for Avengers 1. The rest are 35% or lower. 

The Force Awakens clocks in at a 45% domestic share, but it made 50% more in its US run than Avengers. 



All of this to say: Marvel counts on these films playing well abroad because they're easy to understand properties with a well trodden formula and a decade of exposure to the IP - that sells.  The focus, and motivation, of US moviegoers is a business necessity for Star Wars as it's been an American phenomenon.  Mix that with the newness of its reemergence, and a fan base that's broad because the first film helped kick off the age of blockbusters and you get an incomparable hype train.


Tl;dr - Star Wars hype is unbeatable because of scarcity, focus on US market, and has a broader US fan base due to when it was first released.

And that didn't hit $100M in the middle of summer either, which is my point.

> 1st issue of the 2016 BP series sold 300K, which are sales on par with Batman. It tapered off those numbers, but its representative of the hype and interest in the character.

totally forgot Whedon came in late in production on this... explains a lot.

The overall tone was very dark, dramatic, gritty... but scattered throughout the film were tangents of silliness, goofiness, super hero campyness, it 100% felt like the movie was being pulled in 2 separate directions... a lot of forced in jokes and scenes that felt very out of place in such a dark tone, and literally dark movie.

What has happened is that Avengers has turned into this super bright, overly saturated super fun and enjoyable lighthearted fun movies with a bit of drama thrown in...

Justice league felt like a drama, with the dark, muted colors, focus on story telling and drama rather than action sequences and fun...

It's not really a matter of your opinion, it *is* expensive. Doctor Manhattan cost $17m to be in Watchmen. Skyline was shot on $500k and then spent $9.5m on the VFX. Studios gut the fuck out of VFX budgets so much that the company that did Life of Pi's VFX went bankrupt months after winning the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

I got a bid from a VFX company a few months ago for a month's work on a Dorito's commercial. One guy needed. Bid was $32k. I ended up doing it myself.

If there's one thing Hollywood doesn't like doing, it's needlessly throwing money away. If there's a cheaper alternative - they're already on that shit and exploiting it.

I've worked from some of the companies that worked on Justice League. The quality of work is much, much lower when it is done 'offshore'. Many companies are keeping industry seniors on their main office and sending away some of the less creative work off shore. The senior artists then spend more time fixing bad, rushed work and the quality is reduced. 

And to answer some of your questions on cost, it isn't just computing power and man power that goes into generating this much CGI. One thing people always forget is software licensing cost. This is rented because paying so much for top of the line software that changes every 6 months means your company is out of the game, quickly. This is not a one time cost, like you are guessing. Imagine you are doing a shot filmed without any green screen. You've superman moving at super speed into a shot. What goes into that? Well, on set the actor sort of hops a little bit into his landing pose. In the post world, we start with a computer generated duplicate of superman. Someone has to sculpt this duplicate. They need special software to do that. That software is expensive. The next person needs to shade and look develop this sculpture. Think like coloring but it requires you know how light goes through skin differently than cloth and how to match texture of leather and plastic using a computer. This takes more expensive software AND programmers to make the software work within the pipeline of a company. We are just two steps into recreating an 'easy' vfx scene and it's already expensive. Next comes someone that creates a skeleton system to make the superman model animatable. Again, software licenses, time, expert on human body and muscle deformation. Then an animator makes the movement look realistic. More expensive top of the line software that needed special programmers to bring it into the company because years of special tools and scripts for each art role have made the code messy. Then the cloth simulation. More expensive software. Cloth is simulated for all capes in the DC films. This is done for more creative control but means every shot requires a cg animation double in order to simulate a cloth cape that lines up with the actor. Expensive. Then there are the FX artists that make wiggly lines so superman looks like he is traveling super fast. This software is especially expensive. These artists are expensive. They need to know a bit of science to do their jobs. Their software is very technical and often  requires scripting. It is a rare person that is visually artistic and also good at math and coding. Hard to find and companies pay well to hold onto these people. The final step in the CG pipeline is lighting the superman and cape to fit the scene. Pictures were taken on set. An artist needs to use these pictures to match the scene and make that fake superman look convincing. This software is expensive. When I say expensive I mean $15,000 a license. And generating the frames of the images takes a chain of 100s of high powered computers working together. These computer farms are hugely expensive and are often rented and need people watching them full time. More money. Then the images are sent to a compositor that puts it all together. More software. More expense. Now you have one shot where superman comes into frame at super speed and his cape moves to match. You cant just hire artists at $100,000 and have a functional vfx post house. There is so much more that goes into that expense. 

Another thing people don't consider is the post cost of reshoots. If a vfx house has done 100 shots and suddenly those are scrapped from the film--imagine the above but now there are full backgrounds that were generated. Now the vfx team has to rush to do more full cg scenes. Cg won't look good if it is rushed. As soon as I hear reshoot I know the film is going to look bad because all the original work that went into planning a well thought out project is basically thrown out. Heavy vfx films should be treated like animated features if they are going to turn out with top notch visuals. Less planning means more winging and a big mess overall.

Cgi companies don't keep it 'vague'. All of this process is itemized and costed and bid. Lead artists need to know the costs of their department for hiring for big or small projects. The big farm of computers that generate images is estimated on a nightly basis and expands and contracts to meet project needs. This isn't new stuff either. Feature film makers and producers are well aware of what goes into the post. Vfx supervisors, in a well organized film, are in the early stages of the planning and budgeting process. ",Senshisoldier

He got a break.""

Sounds like someone complaining about not getting work said it.  That isn't reality, it's a catchy little saying.  Honestly, most people can't perform better in a giant feature film and drum up interest and be a solid investment.

> Sticking a ""bankable"" performer on a film seems to make almost no difference in whether or not a film is profitable. Why not cast an unknown who blows away the casting people vs a 20 million dollar gamble, especially in films like this, where it's the character that's more important than who plays him.

I mean the fallacies in your statement are sort of alarming.  They DO matter.

Because the unknown can't act and has most likely never been the god damn LEAD in a major motion picture and had to carry the weight.

> And it cost less to sign an unknown guy than a Ben Affleck.

And you get far less out of it.  You might even suffer from backlash as people turn apathetic and assume it sucks or else a bigger name would be in the role.

> Didn't work for Justice Leagure it seems. BatvsSuper didn't make more money than Dark Knight or The Dark Knight Rises, so under what metric are you using?

Again, your logical fallacies are sort of alarming.  JL was an awful movie.  The Nolan trilogies were very good movies.    BvS was a god awful movie that opened HUGE.

Are you saying Christian Bale ISN'T a big name?  He got paid.

> I've said this elsewhere. With distribution models now being more open, I'd rather see 10 batman movies made by 10 directors, each given 10 million bucks. 

Jesus Christ, no audience would want your film ideas.  No one wants to see 10 Batman movies a year made for 10 million each.  They would largely be absolute shit.

> The odds of those 10 movies being able to recoup that 100 million are probably higher than putting all your eggs in one basket and than having it bomb like Justice League has.

>Just before Wonder Woman came out, I had already made up my mind that I was NOT going to see it - because Man of Steel was underwhelming, Batman v Superman sucked, and Suicide Squad sucked.  The first three DCEU movies went from bad to worse to worst.  I did NOT enjoy any of the previous DCEU movies, so why would I waste my time, money and energy to let another DCEU movie torment me? When a franchise repeatedly put out one product after another that sucked, a wise consumer learned to avoid everything from that franchise. That is just good common sense for being a smart consumers.
>
>Then, when Wonder Woman came out, it got raving reviews and over 90% at Rotten Tomatoes. Which convinced me to give the movie a chance. Just so you know: my original ""default"" position was I was NOT going to see Wonder Woman. I had already decided to avoid DCEU movies because, at that point, everything from that franchise (i.e., Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad) were either underwhelming or awful. When a company kept putting out one low-quality product after another, you avoid everything from that company.
>
>However, the Rotten Tomatoes review score convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance. Let's be clear here: if you take out the RT score from the equation, I would have just stuck to my ""default position"" and skipped Wonder Woman. The RT score convinced me to give the movie a chance. So DC fanboys should stop blaming reviews: I had watched the previous DCEU movies. They sucked. So I had made up my mind that I would avoid everything from that franchise. The RT scores was the only thing that convinced me to give Wonder Woman a chance.
>
>It was the same situation with Justice League. One good movie (Wonder Woman) has not changed my overall negative feelings toward the DCEU franchise. I had already decided I was not going to see anymore DCEU movies - especially DCEU movies made by Zack Snyder - because I hated all of the previous DCEU movies made by Snyder. My ""default"" position was I was going to avoid Justice League - and all future DCEU movies.
>
>However, if Justice League had gotten a good score at Rotten Tomatoes, then I would have given the movie a chance. However, it did not. It got an awful score at RT. So I stuck to my original plan and skip the movie. In the future, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, I will stick to my ""default"" position: I will avoid DCEU movies.
>
>That is the predicament facing DCEU. I believe a lot of moviegoers are in the same position as I am. We watched the previous DCEU movies, and we hated them, so we had decided that we do not want to waste any more money and time on any more DCEU movie. So, unless a DCEU movie gets great reviews, we are just going to pass.

Superman's whole deal is that his power is absolute, so you start exploring the hows and and whys of applying that power. But instead they just introduced a guy just as strong as Superman so they could punch each other into buildings for 20 minutes. Then they did the same thing with the final conflict in BvS.

And the crazy thing is that Snyder already had a character like this that was much more interesting in the Watchmen. Dr. Manhattan is also basically a walking ""I win"" button, so instead of his story being about how strong he is, it's about how his power has changed his perspective and all of his conflict is internal. Once he decides to act, it's over - so the narrative is about the buildup to that decision.

I don't really know much about either of these characters outside of their movie history, but just as a moviegoer I feel like Superman could be a much more compelling character in a movie where it didn't just boil down to punching in the end. ",scatterbrain-d

The final fight scene was just way to dark for a Superman movie.  It would have made the fight much more interesting if Superman was as much invested in saving lives caused by the collateral damage of him and Zod battling than he was in beating Zod.

It was not like the final battle was engaging or anything.  Isn't that the most interesting part about the whole Superman storytelling 'is Superman going to save the people in time'.  Lois Lane hanging from a crashing helicopter etc.  Two almost indestructible characters fighting does not make for engaging storytelling.  Someone hanging on a ledge waiting for someone to rescue them is.  Imaging the suspense if Snyder established that some ordinary people were dying in the final battle then it would raise the suspense/stakes when it came time for Superman to rescue people (the hero does not save the day).

It was just bad/unengaging storytelling.   ",PaddingtonisaFriend

""Not that bad"" was fine for a movie like Thor 2 or Age of Ultron. The MCU has a solid enough reputation, and enough hits that most people are staying invested in it even if they're not big fans of some of the movies. And most of their budgets aren't so bloated that there's much risk of a loss.

Justice League couldn't afford that. They've had one hit out of four movies. That's not a good rep going in. This was also their big movie: the big event featuring the greatest of DC's heroes.

BvS lost money at the box office. It made the studio $366M from ticket sales, and cost $407M to make and release. It only made a profit once you factor in home entertainment and TV sales, and those are less valuable the less money a movie makes. And Justice League cost significantly more to make, and probably had a slightly bigger marketing spend (BvS had a $157M marketing spend). 

There's basically no path to $800M at the box office for Justice League, and it would need to make MORE than that to get profitable.

It's actually depressing that they think people are THAT desperate for a glimpse of an Asian face in a US blockbuster or something.  Like just think this through for a second.  Most of these countries have healthy film industries of their own, in addition to an entire different Asian celebrity world, you really think that the the public turns out for movies because of an Asian face that isn't even a known celebrity in their OWN country, not to mention much of the public, like the American public, doesn't give that much of a shit about celebrities to begin with?  None of the people I know back in my ""home"" country have ever expressed anything remotely along those lines.

It's the same kind of dumbass thinking and logic that leads to failures like JL.  I've yet to see any actual evidence backing up this kind of marketing strategy.  Attracting minorities with diversity representation might work in the US itself but possibly the ONLY ""Asian supporting cast"" that might have actually made a real difference in audience turnout is Fan Bingbing's casting in Days of Future Past, because she's *actually* a big name Asian celebrity.

Iron Man 3, in fact, had a special ""China edition"" (adding more screentime of what pandering Hollywood execs thought Asian audiences would like) that instead got a huge backlash from Chinese audiences.  Perhaps salivating over how Days of Future Past actually did do well at the box office, Iron Man 3 added a random ass shot of her in a hospital (because Tony Stark was taken to China for very specialized medical care since only this one Chinese doctor, an added character, can do it.  Yes, Iron Man, with access to pretty much unlimited technology, goes to China to get shrapnel removed from his chest.  Even the freaking Chinese laughed at this.).

They seem to have gone from one extreme to the other with their decisions.  Superman Returns was too much like the Donner films (which was the actual goal of the director) so make Man of Steel more like the Nolan films.  Then after that there were no structured plans put in place (not meaning a year by year list, but just a general outline).

There's something like 10 plus potential film ideas not including those already in pre-production that all seem to be individual movies.  You could swap the order of most of them and without knowing more details it seems like it wouldn't affect anything.

Unless they are all going to be stand alone movies which seems to be the direction they are going in now there's currently no certainty about which movies are going to be made or any type of end goal for the characters.

Yeah, after seeing a few reviews of JL, I see no end goal or end game for the DCEU. The course correction would have had to happen after MoS. If time was the factor behind MoS shortcomings they either didn't care about them or they didn't realize it.  

A few stand alone movies are probably the best remedy for the DCEU's problems. Too much time, money and good-faith of the fans has been wasted to restart the franchise from zero. Another way would be to use *FLASHpoint* as a ""restore-point"" but that smells like dream-episode/season.

It was trying to do too much, blending too many plots and too divergent tones. I think Zack wanted 3 layers of plot - a bunch of awesome actions scenes with a macguffin plot with a deep tragedy of a girl getting lobotomized. But did only the first layer well while the macguffin plot was laughably simplistic and the 3rd plot wasn't focused on and thus lacked any emotional weight especially when contrasted with hot chicks sword fighting in Japan.

Of all the MCU villains, she definitely felt the most powerful to me, and they didn't nerf her at any point in order to stop her. Having to cause the apocalypse and destroy Asgard just to defeat her was great.

Given that she's the goddess of death, I'm hoping she'll return at some point.",stryker101

I think the era where it's acceptable to spend $300M on a movie is going to go away outside of very rare exceptions. Justice League is proof that people care more about quality than ever before. They're not going to go see a shit Independence Day movie, or a shit Assassins Creed movie, and way less people than you're expecting will go to a Justice League movie if it sucks. 

Fox's Marvel stuff is a great microcosm of what works and what doesn't. Deadpool and Logan both had sub $100M production budgets, and both were big hits and made money. X-Men Apocalypse had a nearly 200M budget, made less than either of those, and lost a good chunk of change.

Flashpoint seems risky.  If you spend a big budget, but no one cares about the characters anyway you end up with another similar event film no one goes to see.

But in my opinion we *do want* another Christopher Reeve. Superman is such a basic character in terms of motivation and story that quite frankly there isn't much to work with. You can’t reinvent his origin story like you can with Batman. As you point out you can’t reinvent the tone of Superman because he is a beacon of hope. You can’t reinvent his ideals because he is the embodiment of truth, justice, and the American way. Snider fucked up Superman because he literally wrote a character that went against the core concept of Superman. That said, even if Snider had gotten those concepts right, we would still need a transcendent actor to carry the Superman character because the simple truth is that Superman’s character is *so rigid* that it *requires* an actor with massive amounts of natural charisma and acting depth to pull off a successful Superman. 

If you watch Christopher Reeve playing Superman, note the body language. Note how much the actor is communicating to the audience with very subtle facial expressions. Batman has dark and brooding and has lots of gadgets and supporting characters. That is why Batman can be reinvented and reimmagined and rebooted so many times. Superman has his himself and his ideals and what he symbolizes. Batman can be carried by clever plot devices, dadgets, and brooding backstories. Much of that can be achieved by backstory events without Batman in the scene, new and clever gaget concepts, and CGI elements to deliver the freshness of the character. But Superman, he needs an *actor* to deliver all of the elements that make Superman interesting and successful.

Sorry for the rant, but in my opinion Superman is harder than any other superhero to nail because it is so dependent on the actor’s performance and delivery. That is why we *do* need an actor on par with Christopher Reeve.",koshpointoh

He definitely takes it like a champ, but in previous wolverine feats, the dude tanks bullets like a champ to the power of a motherfucker lol. In Origins, after he exits the adamantium tank, he takes multiple direct shots from agent Zero, a mutant with marksman powers, and logan continues sprinting rather unfazed.

Or even comparing Logan to healing factor restored Logan, in the same movie, you can see the vast difference in performance when he can rely on the healing factor to be a brute tank. Like origins he runs straight into direct gunfire, this time rifles, and keeps going like the amazing madman he is (praise be to the Hugh Jackedman). To be fair, in that scene, he is hopped up on mutant hgh/roids lol. 

His whole life he lived rather unfamiliar to the burdens of injury, so having to experience them to such a degree like he did in Logan, even if still at a superhuman level, his experience is vastly different now that he gets a closer look at mortality each time he is hurt in Logan.  I think that’s the real beauty of the movie because he for the first time has to contemplate death, and the consequences of his life.

Additionally, He’s not only seeing mortality in himself, but in everyone around him. So he not only has less of an ability to fight, but he also has less of a reason to fight, especially since those he’s seeing die are some of the only friends he’s had. He’s had people in his life die before, of course, but he’s always kept people at a distance and lived as an outsider. He could always leave, but now he can’t just move on, this is his final place and he has to remain in it, looking back on his life and suffer from it, living as a jaundiced, scar ridden man.

That makes his daughters appearance and his final fight so impactful. You can see that he wanted to just be a recluse and follow old habits after professor C died, get the girl there, fulfill his duty then leave. Instead, he goes against habits and internalizes the message of his mentor, choosing to help his daughter at all costs. 

His last flailing stand thus becomes a symbol of his transformative change. It wasn’t brute combat for the sake of winning physically, it was a fight for redemption. The fact that he was fighting that fight while handicapped added to its impact because it meant that he not only made a noble and tough decision, he made it in the face of death, something he has never really had to face like this before.

tldr: Logan > Batman

The only thing about it that could possibly be considered a myth is that its restrained to Hollywood. ALL big corporations do these kinda things. Selling iphones in a country that has high corporate taxes? Make a local ""Apple Local"" company that buys iphones for a really high price from ""Apple International"". After overhead is paid for, ""Apple Local"" either just break even or report a deficit. ""Apple International"" however, which is conveniently registered in The Republic of Tax Haven, is reporting massive profits.

Edit: Tax havens is probably one of the biggest reasons why money is fummeled upwards in Hollywood as well, even tho few contracts are based on profits anymore.

I agree we need a fantastic actor, just like with any character, but just because Superman is simple and basic as a character doesn't mean there isn't a lot to work with. If there wasn't do you think this character would still be around with people telling stories about him after more than 75 years? For instance, classic Superman, on screen, has never really had his core ideals and beliefs tested or pushed before. Is an alien with the powers of a god really the best source of inspiration for humanity? Or is he setting an example we can never live up to and won't allow us to fail or save/improve ourselves by always saving us...not allowing us to solve our own problems? Should any being have as much power as he does? What if he's controlled or manipulated by someone and becomes a threat to humanity? Would we not be safer if he just left? How involved should he be in human affairs? Should he stop wars? End dictatorships? These are complex questions that a morally good, charismatic, shining beacon of hope character like Superman needs to be tested on. Smash his beliefs on rocks and see if they break on not.

Superman isn’t gimmicky like Batman is or most other super hero’s are. He doesn’t have gadgets or magical rings to make him interesting. In order to make Superman’s story interesting you have to test *his character* which requires a really good actor like Christopher Reeves to successfully pull off. A new Batman story can be successful with a new setting and new gadgets. You can’t do that with Superman. The with Superman *is not* that he is basic or simple. The problem is that the stories told with Superman by their very nature require a level of character depth and moral complexity that is simply not required for other characters like Batman, Ironman, ect. because those stories can rely on other elements like technology or magic to prop the story up. When the entire basis of a story centers around the internal conflict of a character to meet and uphold a set of ideals, as with the case of Superman, the story is much harder to write and depends largely on the actor playing Superman to pull off a spectacular performance.",koshpointoh

He is a basic character in that his character and story elements are set in stone. Being an alien from Krypton is fundamental to the idea of the USA being a melting pot for imagrants. Being raised in middle America is fundamental to having traditional American values. Having the Clark Kent alter ego is fundamental to showcasing the contrast between wanting to have the American dream and being a super hero that can do good and uphold his values. His only weakness is kryptonite which is remnants of Krypton is fundamental because kryptonite is as iconic as Superman himself. Standing for Truth, Justice, and the American Way is the principle around which Superman was built and will always continue to be the focal point of the character. 

Let’s contrast that with Batman. His parents were murdered. He fights crime as a bat. He is fundamentally rooted in noir themes. He is a detective. He is a normal human who is rich and intelligent. That is it. The rest of the canvas is free to be painted however you see fit. Batman’s motivations are as simple as fighting the crime that took his parents. He is a detective so come up with a mystery to solve. The setting is night. Invent new gadgets. It is easy to build an original narrative around the core tenants of Batman.

Now let’s look at Superman. You basically can’t change his origin story at all. You can’t really change his upbringing. You can’t change his motivation. So what is left? Internal personal conflict. That takes a hell of a lot of good writing and acting to bring a new and fresh take on Superman. There are very few plot devices left that don’t involve telling the same story over and over again. 

I’m not underselling Superman at all. In fact, he is extremely complicated because he is so locked in to his backstory and ideology that there is little left to change to tell a new story without rehashing the same shit that has been done a million times. So the only avenue left is complex ideological, philosophical, and character driven stories which are very difficult to write and even more difficult to execute. If you throw out superman’s backstory you throw out Superman. If you throw out his ideology, you throw out Superman. Other superheroes are much more easily adapted to modern settings with modern motivations. But there is very little room for reinvention with Superman and it makes the depth of the story and the actor delivering said story paramount to the success of the film. ",koshpointoh

You just can't keep producing terrible scripts one after another and expect it to keep going.

I agree budgets are out of control, but I don't think a $300M JL or BvS is inherently insane, they were just terribly done, you can't live JUST on brand forever. JW was the first movie in forever for a massive brand with Pratt when he was at peak fire. While Blade Runner is an old movie that appeals to cinephiles but is fairly slow and sorta boring especially for general audiences.

It's not hard to predict what will do well at all, big brand + big money = big money.

The problem is that certain studios forgot that the movie that you make affects the brand, and every time you make a bad movie (from a bad script) you damage the brand, until all you have is Damaged brand + big money, which doesn't get you your result.

Stop making terrible movies with terrible scripts by hacks who don't know what they're doing and you can make big expensive movies, but you can't expect to shit out 3 terrible movies and have people still show up, each bad script damages the brand.",Jade_Shift

For DC comic book fans maybe, but for general audiences I don't think so. In my view DC comics sort of um... suck. Basically Batman is the only good one. 


Most non cb fans I know would agree that Superman is a lame boring superhero, in that he's totally overpowered with one contrived weakness. He's the iphone 1 of superheros, sure he started it all off but he's not really all that good a super hero.

I'm sure he has a lot of good will from back when Reeves did him, but that was before my time, and older audiences aren't really your main target for a super hero movie. So ignoring the DCEU movies so far you have one big brand, batman, the rest are pretty lackluster, Wonderwoman and aquaman are crazy lame (again ignoring the current DCEU so far).

So you go into this DCEU with a solid property in batman and a decent property in superman and then a couple sorta junk super heroes. What do you do? 

First thing is fuck up superman. Really taint the brand with a tonally offputting creepy sociopathic version of superman.

Then you take that bad momentum of a displeasing Superman and roll that into batman, Batman is at an all time popularity high and you don't give him a solo movie you pair him with Superman, oh and also really change how Batman behaves compared to the more recent popular portrayals, the new vision of Batman is actually pretty good, but it's in a terrible movie with a terrible Superman (in terms of writing) terrible Joker terrible Lex Luthor.

So the two main brands of an otherwise shaky set of heroes (sorry DC fans...) are heavily tarnished, then you put in another totally overhyped sack of garbage movie SS which totally taints everyones view of your general movie making ability, cap it off with a WW movie (the worst of the properties by far) that is actually really good, except you almost confirm how bad your main franchise line is by how much better a WW movie written directed and starring unrelated people.

WW was almost a reminder that they suck at movie making, well some relative unknowns can make a better movie out of a worse property, so clearly they just suck at movie making.

So I don't agree that it's even a big brand come JL, it's a heavily damaged brand. Brands are brands for the entire market. JL may be popular for comicbook nerds and a certain subset of the audience but the general movie going audience's view of the brand is the movies so far.

JL going into this movie is a **heavily** damaged brand, It's damaged in almost every direction, the makers being perhaps the most damaged part of the brand, the antithesis of Marvel which is a super strong brand because of their succesful movies.

I don't agree at all that anything can fail, the failure of Justice League was very predictable for anyone who has no stake in the DC vs Marvel rivalry.

1ablm4i,The one movie soundtrack you play endlessly?,kjp4j5h,2024-01-26 19:06:17,"Love a good soundtrack! Here's a few picks worth a listen:

Bram Stoker's Dracula by Wojciech Kilar. He captures the romance perfectly, not to mention the magic, the drama and bloodshed. There's an extended version out there somewhere I'd love to hear but it's so hard to get hold of.

Dracula by Phillip Glass and the Kronos Quartet - this was Phillip Glass' attempt to retroactively soundtrack the Bela Lugosi classic Dracula from 1930something. Universally panned for not fitting the film (and it really doesn't) but the music itself is haunting and creepy and pretty at the same time, and suits the story perfectly, if not the film.

In Bruges by (mostly) Carter Burwell. Burwell is a genius and this is a masterstroke of movie music - perfectly conveys the morose and moody parts of the film. The soundtrack also contains On Raglan Road by the Dubliners, and Der Leierman, a song composed by Schubert and sung by Thomas Quasthoff - these are two definitive performances of these songs and well worth a listen!

The Grand Budapest Hotel, aside from being peak Wes Anderson and great cinema, has this fun, quirky, clever score by Alexandre Desplat. He uses a bunch of uncommon, eastern European instruments to create a fittingly energetic and thrilling sound to the caper. 

Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, great mix of songs. Except Mundy's Everything I bestow. I will despise that song forever and a day.

Cruel intentions soundtrack - such a great mix of sultry, sexy and fun songs. Well worth it.

And buried at the bottom of the list, where no-one will read is... the Batman Forever soundtrack. Don't judge me too much, there's some absolute bangers in there, and it opened up my musical education. Tell Me Now by Mazzy Star is (I really don't know how to convey accuratly how it'll make you feel, except maybe imagine some southern beauty queen is hitting on you somewhere quiet on a hot night when you've had a little too much Jack Daniels.

I looooove movie scores. 

I agree with op, the third pirate's score is fire, best Zimmer for Sure. 

This are a few of my favs: 

How to train your dragon: My favourite for working. ""This is Berk"" starts playing and I focus inmediately. Great great score. 

Meet Joe Black and Shawshank Redemption. Thomas Newman is a genius. Shawshank's helped me through some dark times. If Andy Dufresne could, so can I. 

Braveheart. James Horner was brilliant and he is missed. Titanic is amazing, but not so fun to listen, 80% of the score is after the iceberg. But Hymn to the Sea is something special. 

John Williams is the greatest but not my favourite to listen. The Jurassic Park Suite is awesome. So the Binary Sunset score. 

Michael Giacchino is a fav too. His themes for Lost are iconic, Ratatouille beautiful and Society of the Snow is haunting. 

Dario Marianelli's Atonement is another fav. T H E  T Y P E W R I T E R omg amazing.

So, that list in no particular order:

Conan the Barbarian - Basil Poledouris (prob my favourite ever).

Dune - Toto (definitely helped by being a kid at the time who was obsessed with Dune and who didn't have much money to spend on music).

The BSG soundtracks - Bear McCreary (particularly series 2 and 3)

As for the score; there’s not many films where you acknowledge in the cinema, on your first watch, just how good it is. One Day (the love theme), is one of my favourite pieces of music of all time. 

And that opening with prisoners singing Hoist The Colours as they step towards the noose… 💔

As for other scores; I was 6 when that first Potter film came out. I still clearly remember the effect Hedwig’s Theme had on me. It was in all the promotional content on tv. Had me hooked before I even saw the film.

Rush (Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack)  
Album • Eric Clapton • 1992  
10 songs • 41 minutes  
Rush is the soundtrack album for the 1991 film of the same name. Written and performed by Eric Clapton, the soundtrack album includes the song ""Tears in Heaven,"" which won three Grammy awards in 1993.  
In a review of the album, AllMusic Guide wrote: ""This album has far more impact than you might expect from the score to a movie — there's a sense of the music here working something out in Clapton's heart, a sense given a lot of power thanks to the intense, heart-rending passion invoked by some of the turns taken here. At its best, Clapton's music can speak of the pain he feels — and Clapton has rarely been better than he is here.""

I really love the music, but when I go to look for the OST online and listen to it, it sometimes sounds like most of the tracks are slightly altered in the film. I'm not talking about how they use engines for musical enhancement, it feels like the movie removes certain instruments from certain tracks and the music is also slightly different.

I can't seem to find anyone else who notices the same thing I do, so maybe it's just me, I don't know. Fantastic film, stellar soundtrack in even the slight differences between the movie's track and the official score's online.Would 100% recommend listening to it if you haven't already. It gives a great sense of speed, thrill, and danger to each scene.

Star Trek: TMP soundtrack has some really far out tracks like the Cloud approach that are unlike anything I've heard scored. Great for testing high end audio systems. If anybody here has a really ballz out Atmos system listen to that track with the lights off and it will blow your mind and thank me later. Jerry Goldsmith must have dropped a lot of LSD or something when he scores that sequence.

A lot of the older James Bond. The Prague Symphony Orchestra 'Essential James Bond' is especially amazing. Moonraker Flight Into Space by John Barry is the benchmark space opera.

Even tracks like To Zucchabar are composed in a way that is enjoyable as a standalone piece. (Hans has a Live From Prague DVD, and actual tracks from that concert/album online that are really enjoyable to watch and/or listen to as a Hans Z fan - highly recommend.)

Both **Blade Runner**'s - The world's they created and ""He's literally me"" vibes. Favorite tracks are Mesa, Joi, Tears in Rain, OG Opening Suite, Love Theme.

**Drive** OST - ""He's literally me"" part 2. A Real Hero and Nightcall mainly. A few of Cliff M's tracks are enjoyable.

**The Fountain** - The last three tracks of the score are pretty majestic and they build, fall, and build again. Death is the Road to Awe personal fave and I want it to play when I eventually expire. The Last Man also great. 

**Columbus** - exclusively since my favorite artist Hammock scores the film, and less for the okay-ish movie itself. Eliel, Polshek and Warnecke are the ones on repeat. 

**The Grey** - (mainly the popular track The City Surf from Jamin Winans for a game called Ink I think.) I'll never not be thinking about the ending to this movie. One of the very few movies that has ever surprised me.

**Ex Machina** a couple tracks like Ava. Movie is terrifying, music is very pleasant.

There is a brief (and very well filmed) single-shot walk-through of the ship which in passing also introduces all of the characters (each within merely a few seconds).  
Whedon further stream-lined this intro by dropping two characters; they just happen to not be on the ship at that very moment, so they can be introduced later when they show up.

The opening scene also sets the tone/humour of the film while hinting at the stakes. So the audience knows what to expect.",Scrugulus

He was the hired transport captain of the *Wicked Wench*, hired by Cutler Beckett to deliver slaves. Jack freed the slaves, so Cutler Beckett branded him a pirate and sank the *Wicked Wench* to the bottom of the sea. Jack struck a bargain with Davy Jones: Jack's soul in exchange for the resurrection of his ship. And so the *Wicked Wench* was brought back, now named the *Black Pearl*. It's implied that the people he goes to see led by Tia Dalma are the slaves he freed.

In addition, we know he's one of the Brethren Court, his father is Captain Teague, his mother's head was shrunk, that he frequented Singapore and the tropics, and that at some point he visited a convent in Spain, where he seduced Blackbeard's daughter.

As for the people involved in the film though, I couldn't say. It doesn't contradict anything in the movies so I couldn't see them having an issue with it. It just feels like another Jack Sparrow adventure without being a kids book like the Young Jack Sparrow books (although they're not bad they are definitely aimed more at kids whereas this is a novel). I found it added some nice little back stories like have you ever wondered why Jack always wears the sash that he wears? Or how he met Tia Dalma? Or how he first came by the Pearl and why it involved a deal with Davy Jones? Or why Cutler Beckett branded Jack? If you have, then check it out.
