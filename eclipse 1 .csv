A far better movie in the Terminator universe would have just explored the definitions of love and whether what the T-800 experienced could be called love. Whether the drive to protect her is any different from someone who loves her. Whether his need to maintain a healthy relationship and keep her around varies from our own wants and needs.

But also that idea that Rey gets to be so effortlessly powerful, in a way that most standard heros aren’t, is because she’s not a hero, and no longer our protagonist but this natural disaster that some random pilot is gonna have to rally the troops to face, is Finn gonna have to pick up that lightsaber again, try and fail to access the force, and yet embody the Jedi ethos more powerfully than Rey can.

I only saw Mortal Engines once in cinemas, and after a few days I didn't think about it much ever again, but it had this *really* interesting minor antagonist called Shrike who I still vividly remember and who instantly popped to mind with this question. He's one of the last surviving members of an ancient ""race"" of zombie terminators created out of people's corpses - the idea being that their memories and emotions were erased completely, making them heartless killing machines. The villains have him imprisoned in the middle of the ocean but unleash him at the beginning of the second act because he's mysteriously hellbent on hunting the protagonist, who has just escaped from them.

As it turns out, it's because he actually *adopted* her when she was orphaned as a child. He began raising her and caring about her in a very un-heartless way, but lacked the human empathy to help her cope with her trauma - so instead, he offers to resurrect her as a zombie terminator too, in order to erase the pain she feels of losing her mother. She willingly *agrees* and promises to let him do this, but then leaves, and backstory/movie plot happens that I don't remember.

During the brief moments we actually get to see him hunting, he's completely unstoppable and immortal in the face of everything that's thrown at him as he tracks her down, and somehow finds her on a flying sanctuary fortress and singlehandedly burns down the entire thing on his warpath. But when he catches up with her at last, the thing that finally actually kills him is simply that she refuses to keep her promise to him, and it literally *breaks the heart* of this ""heartless"" zombie machine-man. They both clearly still care about each other as he dies, too. It was poignant and beautiful while also being an interesting commentary on humanity while *also* being creepy as anything.

And it was the end of ACT 2, for some reason. The actual ""climax"" might be the most generic third act of a blockbuster that I've ever watched in my life. This absolutely fascinating character, who could have easily been a brilliant major villain, was actually just a background antagonist who had somewhere between 10-20 minutes of screentime in this *whole movie* and was basically never mentioned or relevant to the plot outside of the brief moments he showed up. I know this movie was based on a book and I don't know how he's handled there, but I do know that he's far and away the most interesting character I've ever watched the plot and runtime of a film absolutely *shaft* in favour of a vastly more mediocre story.",TheMHBehindThePage

The trailers made it seem like the movie was about a Spanish crusader who found the fountain of youth and shared it with the queen of Spain, and the two of them went in to live for thousands of years together until she fell ill with something. And then the crusader has to go on some epic interstellar journey looking for a cure.

But what the movie was was a normal and his normal wife who is dying. But the wife writes stories while she's dying. So all the fantastical scenes are just brief interludes of illustrations of her stories that are nothing but paper thin metaphors for her current emotions and situation.

All of the vampire gang parts are so good.

For those of you who haven’t seen the film, the plot is based around a retired super special secret agent (JCVD) who is brought back in for one last mission to track down and capture an international bad guy. On this “last mission”, the bad guy gets the best of him and escapes. JCVD is captured and then taken to a secret island. This island serves as a kind of retirement village for the men formerly considered to be among the world’s most dangerous. JCVD then has to escape from this island and team up with an international arms dealer (Rodman) to pursue vengeance and complete his final mission. 


But wait a minute, hold on. That island idea sounds way more interesting than anything that happens before or after it, but yet we only see 20 minutes of JCVD training and planning his escape. I want island hijinks! Show me island hijinks!",the_chandler

I wanted to know so much more about him as a character. He seemed, to me, like one of the most conflicted of the serial killers, and also obviously had a lot of trauma coming from somewhere. By the end, I felt like given the right influence, he might have been possible to redeem and pull toward the light. I really wanted to know more about how he came to be a part of that group, and what might have influenced him to have a different life, if things had been different. It also got me thinking about what would happen if someone like him did change and want to become a better person -- how would they even do it? Would it be possible, after doing so many horrible things?


I wouldn't say it would be MORE interesting than The Following already was, though.

The first act of the movie does a very nice job setting up the middle quarters that is Breakfast Club adjacent, when a random group of kids (including the most popular kid in school) is thrown together arbitrarily, build connections, etc. with Paul Giamatti’s Paul Hunham there largely as a foil to them (albeit one who’s been given a good amount of setup and gets time to himself).

Then everyone but one of the kids gets literally picked up by a helicopter and disappears from the main plot entirely, and from the movie until the last few minutes.

I *love* the rest of *The Holdovers*, but it definitely goes from a complex tapestry to something much starker, and you feel the loss of that color and multi-faceted dynamics.

In this case, I think it accomplishes something like what *Pschyo* does after the first murder, and our audience sympathy transfers onto the much more prickly and ambiguous Norman. Building up and then snatching away all the youthful foolishness, hijinks, douchebaggeru, and camaraderie makes us more primed to sympathize with Angus’ rebellious assholery and see a complex friendship form between Angus and Paul, rather than expect a more straightforwardly heartwarming “young man and jaded old man learn from each other.”

Counterintuitively, I think it also solves the narrative problem of Angus being an old soul who’s not really the life of the party by making his shifting behavior across contexts the “interesting” thing. My favorite example is the mirroring of him breaking the rules by antagonizing Paul and running around the school mocking him, and him breaking the rules much more severely in some ways by stealing Paul’s key and…doing fundamentally harmless things, ending with him sitting respectfully in the chapel as Mary comes in.",SandpaperTeddyBear

The entire time I felt this movie should have been a straight drama rather than a thriller. The pacing and score were so frantic and it seemed to clash with all these interesting characters on screen that never had a chance to develop. Cinematography became a distraction despite it being pretty. Actors were under utilized to make way for a sense of adrenaline in the Vatican for a movie with very little physical action. More dialogue and silence, less glamour and suspense. I would have preferred a more ""boring"" movie.

It could've been like the original Harry Potter series, most of those movies didn't really revolve around Voldemort, there was other school stuff and other obstacles to overcome, but then by the end there'd be a revelation about how Voldemort was somehow responsible for/tied to some of the problems that Harry Potter had been dealing with.

Could've done the same with the Fantastic Beasts movies, maybe Newt would've been spending most of a movie trying to stop a bunch of poachers or something, and then in the finale it'd be revealed that the poachers are working for Wizard Hitler because Wizard Hitler wants to make a special potion using the magical ingredient that a certain magical creature provides.

As Gorr continues his onslaught, Zeus calls a council of the gods; the summons for Thor is tied to Mjolnir, not Stormbreaker (the joke is Zeus didn't update his contacts list), so Jane arrives.  Gorr attacks the council, and Thor arrives with the Guardians of the Galaxy to repulse him (wielding Mjolnir in *Endgame* left some residual trace that let the summons softly ping Thor but it took him a minute to figure out what that was).  The Guardians are beat up during the battle and agree that fighting Gorr again is above their pay grade, so they nope out.  Thor brings in Valkyrie (leave Korg at home to play his video games), recruits Hercules at Zeus' request (Gorr lands a blow on Zeus that doesn't kill him but incapacitates him enough to put him out of action; Valkyrie ""borrows"" his lightning bolt), and they eventually corner Gorr as he's about to slay another god (some deep-cut god that can show up as an ally in a future film).

With a concurrent running series about the war between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, properly fleshed out. It could have been an intensely personal tragic look into love and war. They fumbled the story so, so hard. Imagine the grounded basic story of the struggle within Dumbledore, a real relatable grounded human thing being the main struggle, framed between these two absolute titans of magic capable of doing things only hinted about with Dumbledore and Voldemorts duel in the main original series.

Have Grindelwald be intensely likeable, charming beautiful but an absolute ruthless monster.

I'm not sure how complete it was, but a script is out there that would have been more in line with The Last Jedi, and Broom Kid becomes a featured character.

And I think Rey was supposed to remain a ""nobody"", which was far more in line with the themes the movies were already setting up, that the nature of The Force was changing, and it no longer belonged to any group of people, Sith or Jedi.

I don't absolutely hate Rise of Skywalker as much as apparently everyone else does, but when JJ Abrams took over as director, he basically did the same thing George Lucas did after Empire, and attempted a ""course correction"". 

So while both Empire and Last Jedi are more challenging films that raise the stakes super high and end on a (still hopeful) down note, Return of the Jedi and Rise of Skywalker both kind of abandon some of the loftier themes proposed in their previous films to bring it back to popcorn entertainment.

I understand the later movies are a lot better than the first few.

First movie, some sexual tension with the other female agent, but they don't even kiss or anything.

Second movie, we get a 30 minute introduction that's dedicated to Ethan recruiting Thandie Newton, but it really just seems like an excuse for these two to bang. There's extreme sexual tension for the rest of the movie, and then they ride off into the sunset together.

Third movie, Thandie Newton is forgotten and Ethan is now engaged, but it's back to just being a mostly sweet romance where his fiancee gets dragged into a murder plot.

Fourth movie, they >!suggest that his fiancee has died before revealing that she's secretly alive and faked her death so that she can live in peace.!<

The thing is, I don’t know if this was the intent, but Ridley Scott also needs to stop playing the “Rome is being ruined by scheming queer politicians, and needs some no-nonsense military men to sort shit out” straight.  

Because literally the whole point of the political crisis Rome is about to go through in the 3rd century, is the army deciding it can rule without the rest of the society, and throwing up a series of no nonsense soldier emperors, to help them capture more and more of the state’s resources.  And it breaks everything.

Caracalla himself is one of these, who spent almost his entire life being raised in his father’s military camps, before ruling most of the time from military camps on the frontier.  His dad’s last words to his sons were famously “Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, scorn all others”.  Now he didn’t follow through with the whole “be harmonious, don’t murder your brother” thing, but definitely checked off the enriching the soldiers and scorning all others boxes. 

Hmm, I wonder if there are any contemporary political events that might make us connect with the theme of questioning whether our desire for a strong man to lead us and break the system of politics as usual might not be a great thing?

Edit: We literally call this dude by his nickname “Caracalla” referring to a Gallic style soldier’s cloak, because he spent so much time in cold Northern Amy camps wearing one, instead of his legal name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.",Justin_123456

The difference would be that the Republic could struggle politically & ethically with whether or not to use some kind of super weapon (maybe even Luke himself - whom they need to find to power the weapon via the Force, let's say) to obliterate the fledgling First Order, & while they dither, the First Order attacks the Republic in a move similar to the Death Star trench run and secures enough of a victory to cripple the Republic, which again would be an inverse outcome of A New Hope, and subvert expectations as to what fans thought they'd see in Episode 7. Inversion & subversion in one fell swoop. 

And to your point, an interesting through-line for the ST would be industries siding with the First Order as it became apparent that they were gaining the upper hand. The subtext of a cause being righteous for some only in so far as it can make them money would add some complexity & moral ambiguity, which was only hinted at in The Last Jedi. 

Of course, would it have killed JJ & Lawrence Kasdan to give even a smidge of explanation about the First Order's status in The Force Awakens? Or even the current state of the galaxy's politics? Not finding out why the FO had such strong financial backing & military might (perhaps explained via Snoke's character),  or what the Republic's role in the galaxy was felt like a missed opportunity. Too much was glossed over & it ultimately felt unsatisfying, since the movie was an exercise in hitting the main beats of Star Wars.",ThereWillBWales

“Flash sideways”:
The final episodes feature an alternate timeline, called the “flash sideways,” where characters interact as if they were alive but with subtle hints of their past lives on the island, revealing their deceased status. 

Island as a purgatory:
The island itself is interpreted as a place where the characters were meant to confront their personal issues and prepare for their eventual “passing”. 

Jack’s sacrifice:
Jack is shown to sacrifice himself to save the island, leading to his death and arrival in the afterlife. 

Reunion and closure:
The final scene in the church symbolizes the characters finally finding peace and closure with each other after their time on the island",EagleDre

He just sort of stumbles upon the *story* of the film, which is Furiosa’s quest and struggle with Joe.

Lucas likes to say he had Star Wars planned out from the beginning, but if you listen to his collaborators it becomes very obvious that wasn't true. 

Lawrence Kasdan claims he came up with the Vader is Luke's father twist. Luke was originally going to have a sister training in another part of the Galaxy who wasn't Leia. The OT was originally going to go past three films with Luke turning to the Dark Side.

All the twists and changes came as the movies were being written and made. There was a longer screenplay that Lucas broke up into parts, adapting the first act into the first Star Wars, but it's very different from what we ended up getting by Return of the Jedi.

Disney (and JJ by extension) just didn't have the balls to go where Last Jedi had set them up for. JJ's got his good points as a writer/producer/director, but at the end of the day he played it too safe.",sauronthegr8

It definitely *feels* set in the late 00s (they buy flip phones, have a meeting in a cybercafe, and need to have 9/11 explained to them) but I don't think that's a bad thing. They are displaced in time anyway, so feeling a little ""off"" and retro in terms of timeframe is okay.

Some of it might actually work better now than it did back then. I remember it being difficult for them to get hold of certain new powerful GPUs, and that a chess-playing AI had ""moods"". Probably worth a rewatch now moody AIs are more like everyday life than sci-fi and everybody understands the relevance of powerful GPUs.

There was a lull in the second season due to the writer's strike, but it ended strongly. On a cliffhanger if that bothers you. Some interesting philosophical questions come up, and they do a couple of things that I haven't seen other shows do (>!for instance, killing a main character instantly mid-scene with no fanfare and just carrying on, Derek and Jesse discovering they weren't each other's Derek and Jesse, and Jesse's mission basically being a mirror of a Terminator's mission!<).

I’m probably not remembering all the details but basically he lied about his age to participate in the civil war, on the wrong side. He encountered 3 vampires thinking they were early teens. They changed him because they could tell he’d have special powers. 

Then, he helped train and turn humans into vampires. They’d kill all of them before they were 1 in vampire years, either fighting in the “vampire wars” (which were fought for good territory to hunt humans), or just straight murdering them at 1 year because their strength waned at 1 year. 

He encountered a vampire he grew fond of (it’s also implied he had a weird relationship with one of the vampires who turned him, again supposed to be a young teen) in a platonic way. Refused to kill him and let him go. Left the vampire wars because he was tired of killing. Quit drinking human blood because he was tired of killing.

Fighting off that standard sort of immortal ennui that is a common trope, with the added bit of 'if I become too aloof it will be harder to remember why I don't eat them'.

I think the books also say that they don't always do high school, sometimes they do just go straight to college or working, or some will branch off and live as married couples and skip the school. Then between living 'normal' lives they go live apart for chunks of time, like in I think Alaska with that other group of vampires that don't eat people.

Also, to be fair, they are all beautiful, not going through puberty or dealing with teen insecurities, they already know the content so it isn't a struggle academically, they are *bored* and looking to fill their lives with things to do, and they are rich while having a built-in supportive social group in their 'siblings', so their high school experience isn't really the standard sort of unpleasant many people get.",Mindelan

* **Transformers: The Last Knight** - As I mentioned last week, TLK was under-performing in every market besides China. Well it seems that while the opening was huge the vast majority of Chinese people are done with the franchise as the film dropped 82% this weekend in China. That's not only the biggest drop for a Transformers film in the country but one of the biggest ever for an American release. It seems to be an extreme reaction from the audience as the film received a terrible score on their IMDB equivalent Douban, one of the worst for a major release. China seemed to be the saving grace for the franchise but at this rate the franchise is in dire straits, even as T5 approaches $500M worldwide. 

* **The Big Sick** - The film continues to have incredible returns as it inches it's way towards a wide release. This weekend it played in 71 theater earning $1.67M, a per theater average of $23,550. It's still on track for a wide release in two weeks. 

**Notable film closings** 

* **Hidden Figures** - The surprise hit of the Oscar season has closed to a phenomenal $169.3M domestic and	$230.2M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The film debuted in wide release in January to a respectable $22.8M but had some of the best drops for a wide release in years, dropping less than 30% for it's first 9 weeks in wide release. The film had some of the best legs I've ever seen with a multiplier of 7.4x and a per theater average that didn't drop below $1,000 until week 19. This film was a major victory (alongside Get Out) for films starring black protagonists and a testament to the power of crowd pleasing biopics.

* **The Case for Christ** - The latest Pure Flix vehicle has closed to a solid $14.6M domestic and $15.4M worldwide on a budget of $3M. The company's first biopic received fairly good reviews and bucked the trend of some of their recent flops and while it didn't make God's Not Dead money the film still came out very profitable. At this point Pure Flix are the only other company constantly playing with the Blumhouse model of small scale releases with the occasional big hit bankrolling the entire company, and it's working very well for them.

This has worried me too. August is usually much kinder to original films and non established franchises than June and July have been. And while that A- Cinemascore is very good, it probably would have been much better if it was a full A. It also hurts that its R rated, and in family months like these that's not really a good sign. 

We'll see how it does next week, especially going against *Spider-Man: Homecoming*. If it keeps steady then as well, *Baby Driver* could do similar R rated late June business like *Magic Mike*, *The Heat*, *This is The End* and a few more did. ",BPsandman84

I'm thrilled that it's clear that Wonder Woman will overtake Guardians 2 as the second biggest film of the year (at least domestically). It was the best superhero film I've seen in a very long time. Very deserving. ",crank1tup

So much of that movie is dumb and unnecessary. When the German soldiers storm the Amazon's beach, why do they all give up the high ground and jump down to be completely level with the enemy?

Why do they jump off a horse, do a 360 McTwist, and then shoot arrows? It doesn't make any sense.

Chris Pine's group of friends serve next to no purpose. Oh, here's a Native American character in the front lines of WWI because that makes sense. Their presence makes no sense.

When walking head-first into machine gun fire, how is it possible that all of those bullets go precisely to her wrists? 

That movie was garbage. I honestly think critics were afraid of being called a sexist for panning it but that really is what it deserved. It was just a genuinely bad movie. Cheesy and dumb.

Dunkirk just seems like a war rescue story, like the 3 of 4 recent movies where ordinary people go out to preform an extraordinary rescue.

I honestly couldn't tell you who the lead is. Also, we're talking Spielberg and Hanks, Nolan isn't quite up there yet with ubiquity of brand. 

What I don't understand is how the marketing for Nolan films have been so bad -- I wonder if he just really wants to keep things under wraps. All I can remember from interstellar is just a Michael Caine voiceover, McConaughey driving a pickup, and random shots of Anne Hathaway.

Dunkirk wasn't satisfying for anyone involved. The British rescued most of their manpower but lost all of their equipment. The Germans pushed the British back to their island but failed to destroy the British army. The battle was a delay in the war, not a conclusion to anything.

Even in Empire Strikes Back, where the Empire thoroughly trounced the Rebellion, there were still gains made by the protagonists. Luke became a Jedi during this movie and learned that his father was a different man than his daddy. This movie was primarily about Luke's character development at a high cost; Echo Base destroyed, Yoda dies, Han Solo frozen and captured, and of course the loss of Luke's right hand and the loss of his lightsaber.

Unlike Empire Strikes Back which is a dark movie where the antagonists win, Dunkirk would be a movie where the protagonists retreat without accomplishing anything at all. ",Hyndis

Shouldn't it be a problem for any director if your story has no narrative?

The trailers really don't show any arc or line or any pattern. Just a collage of shots.  I'm sure it will be technically amazing, but so was Avatar, and at least that had a narrative. 

It's basically Pearl Harbor minus the love triangle. Michael Bay competently portrayed the action scenes there. 

But you know what's more compelling? Documentaries and shows about WWII and even books. I ***personally*** don't want to sit for 2.5 hours paying $17.75 for IMAX to watch recreation of action pieces with characters I don't care about. 

The Hurt Locker's sniper scene was just 2v2, a lot of quiet, but full of intensity and high stakes. Still ""war."" Still tension. 

When Ralph Fiennes showed up, he was the second guy after Guy Pearce I recognized, and I felt a comfort with him on screen since I obviously knew him among unknowns. I think he was cast for his likeness, because when he was shot and killed within 10 minutes, I felt something new I hadn't felt watching action films -- actual bit of fear, it felt like I watched a friend in a strange land with no one I know get shot and killed from someone somewhere unseen. An unknown would have no impact. He was a huge name. 

I feel crazy in wanting a narrative...and you can't criticize Nolan without getting downvoted to irrelevance/silence. 

I've always had a theory that Nolan's filmography has been dependent on whether they were adapted from something or original stories. Inception and Interstellar had absolutely amazing ideas I feel that many screenwriters thought ""damn, he wasted a great concept on a terrible story.""

It's why I don't mind if he remakes a Bond film. He's not particularly imaginative or original with stories, as his best stories are borrowed to some degree. 

IMO, Inception's 2 main problems are 1) no real narrative, other than Cobb needs to get home but in the end he doesn't care if he's actually home or dreaming, and literally NO other characters changed from their first to their last minute, and 2) it was visually unimaginative. My dreams definitely aren't clear like that; I definitely can't read in dreams, I can't walk and talk with everything clear -- dreams are more visceral than visual; you see something but you feel an emotion to it, you feel what your conversation was about with perhaps some semblance of words. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind does a better job depicting absurdity of what dreams feel like even though they're memories; like the faceless employees, or tiny Joel under the table, or large objects flying away...I feel like dreams are closer to that. 

And Interstellar...ugh. Despite the controversial climax, I felt far more enthralled and in awe of the enormity of space watching Contact for the first time since 1997 in 2014 after Interstellar, and 97% of Contact takes place on Earth. Again, IMO interstellar failed from lack of imagination. The planets just seemed too...Earth-like. I feel like there would be some form of life on those planets. ",Death_Star_

""Hiding."" That's the thing. 

It's not intentional hiding. It's ""natural selection"" due to Nolan's method of film-making, which doesn't lend itself well to well-made trailers in *any* of the most popular conventional forms. 

Why?

Because Nolan's films just don't have scenes that are both exciting but non-essential/spoiler. His films are dense, the content-less shots don't excite anyone (like the Dark Knight opening scene with IMAX shots of shiny buildings). The filler scenes are really boring. In the Dark Knight Rises, Bruce/Batman is either doing something spoiler-heavy (fighting Bane, fighting alongside Robin, fighting Bane, trying to escape the prison) or boring (his scenes with Catwoman at her place, where he's just having conversations, they don't fit in a trailer). 

The Prestige is worse. 

Look at this  [HORRIBLE TRAILER](https://youtu.be/o4gHCmTQDVI) for The Prestige. It's not exciting, it's cut like it's used to cause seizures, none of it makes sense as a narrative. 

The Prestige trailer had to be cut that way because it couldn't be cut without spoiling or boring the viewers. Like when Borden argues about tying a more difficult knot -- it makes no sense in a trailer. But then Borden being asked at a funeral what knot he tied by Angier makes it look like he murdered Angier's wife, which spoils, but misleads the viewer into thinking that's what the movie is about. 

The Prestige would gross $500 million today based on everyone's reputation (it was 1 year after Bale was Batman and 6 years after American Psycho, a cult hit. It was only 6 years since Jackman was Wolverine for the first time -- he just finished his 17th year as Wolverine. 

But the film was barely OK commercially but much better on DVD due to word of mouth. 

Why? Because no one knew what the hell it was about. The Prestige doesn't sound like a magician movie. The trailers were awful like above. Reviews were good. Word of mouth was good.... but it was pre Twitter and pre Facebook being #1. 

**His movies are so dense with so many different scenes necessary to make up the story that no single trailer can be shown in a ""normal fashion"" without boring or spoiling people.** 

It's why Warner Bros was forced to skip trailers and instead promote both Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises with the actual opening scenes available online before the movie release, like the joker robbery scene and the Bane crashing the plane. 

They figured that rather than spoil a whole movie or most of it, they might as well show the most of a 6 minute scene that's not totally crucial to the film and something where if you caught 5 seconds of it in a trailer, you would know what would end up happening. 

Like, Bane in a plane like that is surviving and crashing it to survive if we see a glimpse. And they show it all instead. 

Showing Bruce in a prison makes it obvious that he will break out somehow. 

Showing one masked clown carelessly gun down his associates makes it obvious it's the joker. So they show the whole scene. 

The trailers were awful. Full of either spoiler scenes (the football field is definitely imploding, especially with it being the only scene featuring football, the mayor is getting blown up, Batman gets his back broken etc) or nonsense (Catwoman, presumably because we don't see her face, falling backwards out of a window, catwoman doing a weird cartwheel in a men's prison). 

The interstellar trailers were the worst.  They didn't spoil a thing but they didn't show anything interesting. 

I'm sorry, but the same shot of McConaghey crying while driving his pick up in all 3 trailers in a movie called INTERSTELLAR doesn't sell me on the film. 

I just remember a lot of dust and then random space shots and nothing interstellar. 

**TLDR Nolan's films are so densely packed that marketing them is near impossible without spoiling or boring viewers. It's like 90% spoiler scenes and 10% filler scenes.**

The overlap between Nolan's own films between TDK and TDKR (I leave off Batman Begins because it's such a low performer) and his other films made after TDK is only about 70%. That means 30% of the box office for the Nolan Batman films just vanishes when he works on anything else.

On the other hand, the average Avengers film does twice the box office that a Nolan film does, which means there's not much proven overlap between comic book movies in general and Nolan films in general at all.

Furthermore, Saving Private Ryan, which was a *uniquely* successful war movie, did 630 million in inflation-adjusted box office while Spider-Man, released a couple years later, did 1.1 billion dollars in box office.

Basically, Wonder Woman's box office is likely going to do better than the best non-Batman Nolan film ever made, there's no evidence the same audience watches the same movies in significant numbers, therefore the only real threat to Wonder Woman's dominance is a big tent blockbuster with an untarnishable franchise that does huge box office no matter its quality -- Spider-Man.

The fact is though, Christopher Nolan is almost a genre upon himself, this sub is the perfect example of that. The 18-25 demographic (same one that loves superheroes) thinks he's literally the best director ever and he has a rabid following since TDK. Expect Dunkirk will do similar to Inception and Interstellar, as it's rated PG-13 and not R, as Saving Private Ryan was.

1d5nkld,Lack of mainstream werewolf movies,l6mpa7k,2024-06-01 14:36:55,"I very much agree that there aren't a lot of werewolf movies in general, but I think it's the same reason that Hulk movies are viewed as ""not working"" to a broad audience. If you think of the characters you've listed, the movies that involve those characters either focus on the humanity pieces (what humanity is or isn't left of the character) and/or how it effects the humans around. (I'm sure there are examples that disprove my point, but I think from a BROAD view of the genre, that point holds). The broader audience wants to be able to connect. Sure the moments that the werewolf is in human form could be engaging and relatable, but then the audience literally loses that character they are connecting with when the character transforms. Then they have to watch that now transformed character either be a rabid animal, or it's something like Teen Wolf. From a storytelling perspective (in film), it's hard to show what the werewolf is thinking and typically, werewolves don't speak. So what is their ""motivation"" what is driving the character to move forward, when in reality the audience is watching two different characters in one.  

I'm not suggesting that this is correct or the way it SHOULD be, but mainstream film wants to reach as broad of an audience as possible and coming up with stories that check that box typically outweigh the creative process. This is just 100% my theory around it, but I also think it's why werewolf stories don't typically work great in film.

It's not like vampires and witches where you can do a lot more with them as they aren't typically bound by those same constraints. Vampires have the whole sunlight thing but that still gives you a lot more freedom - and in most cases they are still in their right mind, have control over themselves and a lot more agency. There's really only so many times you can do the ""person with werewolf-ism tries to find a cure"" story... oh gee, does he eventually give in when it's time to fight the main villain? Even the best werewolf movies tend to follow the tried and true formula.",greg225

There were some pretty big attempts to mainstream werewolves again the the 90s (Wolf) and 2000s (Cursed and The Wolfman), and I thought all three were fine, but none seemed to excite audiences, and studios took a bath on them. So, they see werewolves as cursed, I guess.

Besides that werewolves lose out to vampires in mass market sex appeal. There’s definitely an untapped core niche market out there for it though.

Each play on societal fears from different angles. 

Vampires represent an elite class using the common man to further their aims. The normies are almost powerless to resist them either through force because the vamps are stronger and faster (like the centuries old tradition of monied interests) or through mind control (propaganda). 

Zombies are the other end- an unstoppable force of nature that can’t be reasoned with. They kill not through malice, but because that’s what they do. Could also be a fear of having one’s resources taken by the “lower” classes. 

I just don’t think werewolves have an easily translated trope to play on. They just aren’t that scary. They aren’t cunning, and as a force of nature, there usually aren’t wave after wave of them like zombies. Kill a few and you’re usually fine.

Or a Victorian-era detective movie about a mysterious serial killer that only kills once a month.

Just look at Van Helsing. It's basically a werewolf movie, even though there are plenty of other mythological creatures in it. The werewolves are very central to the plotline and it even turns into an actual werewolf movie near the end (without wanting to spoil anything if someone here hasn't seen it).

Someone else said below that the Hulk is conceptually the same thing, and even then they have been struggling with the character for a while, to the point where they decided to just make him speak and think and act like a person.

I know you don't plan on doing this again, but with this many previously un-seen films under your belt, I'd urge you to explore a bit more and see some movies that, frankly, blow away much of what's on your list.",nickyeyez

Many of your movies that aren't bolded (so first time watching them) are extremely high-profile, popular movies. By that I mean that they're movies which it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that someone committing to a resolution like that would've already seen. You would think someone committing to a resolution like this would already be a huge movie buff yet the list of first-time viewings doesn't exactly corroborate that expectation. Know what I mean?

So my curiosity is this: what prompted you to decide to undertake this resolution? Did you feel like you weren't as well-versed (well-watched?) in movies as you wanted to be? Are you actually a huge movie buff who just never bothered with the movies/franchises on your list?

Again, I hope this doesn't offend you somehow, I'm just genuinely curious. It's still impressive as hell. I could never do a movie every single day. Sometimes I just don't want to watch a movie. I also don't like watching movies when I'm not in the mood because I feel like I don't enjoy them or appreciate them nearly as much. I just discovered Letterboxd recently and now I'm making a goal of 100 movies for this year.",POFF_Casablanca

I think that is a shame personally and if you decide to keep watching a lot of movies (doesn't have to be so strict and daily ofc) i would suggest adding some. There are good movies coming from all over the world, definitely broadens your horizon if you try to engage different cultures and their tropes in art this way.

Although it's OK to find 5-10 better movies among 30, or 50-120 among 365, 

\- I don't think it's really relevant to rank Wall-E or Spirited Away in comparison to Donny Darko or The Ten Commandments.

\- As you noticed with movies you already watched, that's subject to change even for the same person. 

So I find easier to put them in 3 classes: - those that are definitely my favorite, - those I'd definitely forget, - and those I'm not sure about.

&#x200B;

Another thing I noticed  is that it's not just about movies: It's also about directors and writers:

\- some of them make movies you ever want to watch: Hitchcock, Wilder, Spielberg, Allen, the Cohen Bros, Anderson (at least for me), Ford, Pollack, Polanski, Miyasaki, Lean, ... Pete Docter, Ernest Lehman ... whatever the genre. Usually, these guys have a special ""voice"", special skills.

\- Some of them can alternate masterpieces and stinkers without apparent cause (Zemeckis, Scott ...) so you only remember the masterpieces.

\- Some of them make movies you can't bear, good or not,  because you don't like their voice even if they are obviously skilled (e.g. for me Michael Bay).

\- And some of them make average movies you usually like watching.

\- Not to mention those who only make stinkers, of whom I can't remember any name...",JMMaza

Sleep can easily fill the remaining time of each day as a necessity.  (WHO claims lack of sleep as a risk for cancer).
