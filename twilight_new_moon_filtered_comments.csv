It depends how you mean. I think it's the most fascinatingly bad. It has the most ""problematic"" elements when people viewed Twilight solely as something to bash. I feel like when people mention how toxic Twilight was/is New Moon is what they're thinking of mostly whether they're conscious of it or not. And I think it's pretty interesting to watch it and dissect what they mean and how warranted it is.

Bella thrill chasing as a replacement for the high she got being with Edward is at least a semblance of an interesting idea (Simply wrong to portray that as true love, but at least a character like Jessica calls it out?), Jacob seemingly succumbing to a cult from Bella's perspective is another fragment of a good idea. 

So much mystery remained from the first film that is explained in New Moon. Even though I grew out of Twilight years ago I still think world-building and character stuff is a lot more interesting than the most memorable antagonistic threat possible or big battles or a lot of events happening, and that applies here. The first film feels downright indie and Eclipse the big budget monster the trajectory of the series was destined for and New Moon is something of a compromise between the two.
