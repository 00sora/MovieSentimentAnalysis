>I don't know how to read it from a teenage gi... or any kind of woman's perspective I guess. I don't really know why they like it but what I thought was weird about it and the reaction I had with it was... um.... When I read it seemed like, I was convinced that Stephanie was convinced she was Bella, and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. And you're like reading her... her sort of sexual fantasy about some, and especially when she says it was based on a dream and it's like, *""Oh I've had this dream about this real sexy guy,""* and she just writes this book about it. And like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced that... this woman is mad, she's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation. And like sometimes you feel uncomfortable reading this thing and I think a lot of people feel that it is, in the same way it's kinda voyeuristic and... it's kinda a sick pleasure in a lot of ways. But then it kinda introduces the action elements and.... and it is very honest, it's really, really honest and that's kinda what's weird about it

Now take that hype and magnify it x10. That's how bug Twilight was during that time. I think some just werent alive to experience it or maybe forgot about it's cultural impact.

I'm having a hard time believing this movie wasn't made tongue in cheek or purposely campy.,kt5rr72,2024-03-03 15:48:05,"The books were written with the same modus operandi as most fan-fiction: escapist self-insert “stories” to act out a juvenile personal fantasy.

As such, it suffers from the typical problems of amateur writing: a perfect main character who gets everything without having to sacrifice anything. A star struck romance seemingly built upon nothing. An author so in love with their own characters that none of the conflict is the result of personal faults within the core group, thus every conflict has to be contrived as a random outside threat motivated by jealousy.

These kinds of stories BEFORE the success of Twilight used to stay private or circulate within niche groups online. Twilight really was a phenomenon however and moved this type of thing into the mainstream. 

Twilight’s success is because it taps into the desires of so many young people who are first starting to consider an adult life: an eternal romance, being the object of desire of two gorgeous men who aren’t motivated by sex, a new and perfect family that welcomes you with open arms and loves you unconditionally, having a child with an accelerated growth rate that you don’t actually have to raise thus skipping over the messy parts of child rearing, etc. 

The fantasy has everything. There is no real suffering, no internal conflict, no sacrifice. Everyone remains perfect, safe, and most importantly: beautiful and young- forever. 

It’s childish and paper thin, but it’s fun and cathartic for the people who get it and understand its value. Escapism and fantasy are good, they are a release valve for frustrated people. I believe the filmmakers understood this, but I don’t think the author (a Mormon housewife) really understood the camp value as she wrote it (I’m sure she sees it now however). 

I think Twilight is a great big silly mess that is unintentionally a triumph. It also completely subverts most “feminist” tropes and has a main character who ultimately chooses to pro-life the fetus that is actively killing her, chooses to be a trad wife at 18 just because she’s so horny for dick, and chooses to tell the sexy werewolf (who values her for her humanity above all else) to fuck off. It’s a weird type of punk conservatism.",None

The fact that the quieter, introspective person is a teenage girl whose insights aren't all that amazing shouldn't make us think better of the movie or worse of the books. It's realistic that a person that young wouldn't be thinking the next great thoughts in art, philosophy, or science.

An interesting frame to understand these movies through is Stephanie Meyers' Mormon faith.

Neither my wife nor I have ever seen them. We made it about a half hour in before we just couldn’t anymore. 

Our key takeaways were:

1. The first time Bella sits down next to Edward in science class, we couldn’t tell if he threw up in his mouth a little or got a “fang erection” from the way he was holding his hand over his mouth. We spent the rest of the time assuming that when either vampires or early 2000s high schoolers get turned on, they get super nauseated. We missed a surprising amount of dialog because every time Bella and Edward made eye contact we all made sounds like we were working on a hairball. 
2. There is SO. MUCH. EYE FUCKING. in the first half hour. Apparently “being hot” in this world involves staring fixedly and creepily at the object of your lust from a range of six inches to ten feet away. Oddly, everyone else around you will be entirely oblivious to your eyes being literally glued to some other person even when they are attempting to ask you to prom. 
3. Gaslighting is the hottest kind of flirting. Just straight up bald faced denials of things a person directly saw for which there is no rational explanation will make you absolutely irresistible to the person you desire. 
4. I don’t know how old Edward actually is, but if it’s anywhere over the age of ten he is an astonishingly bad liar. His eyes *changed* and the best thing he can come up with is “it’s the fluorescent lights” and then running away??!
5. Every single time a character is introduced in this movie they are somehow *even paler* than any character who came before. Except the Native American characters, obviously.

They’re not vampires they’re faeries. This explains why they can use magic, essentially fly and why different families have different abilities such as helping things grow and control water ect. Before the unfortunate events that we got to bear witness to there was a war between vampires and the fae. One thing the fae are famous for is replacing children with Changelings. They would murder a vampire but instead of having the vamp disappear they would infiltrate the nest and take them down from the inside which led to the vampires becoming extinct but a few factions of changelings not going through the correct procedure to evolve into a fae and being stuck with the mindset of a vampire.

Twilight is a really exceptional series of books. Truly exceptional. They are well written, compelling, interesting story. But it's a story that's told in the first person narrative of a teenage girl from beginning to end.

They did a HORRENDOUS job of adapting it to a screenplay. 90% of the most interesting dialogue from the novel happens either inside Bella's head, or during extended scenes that just could never make it to screen, because film pacing doesn't work that way.

Somewhere along the line, it was also decided that general appeal for this should be teeny boppers, so they dumbed down the dialog to sound like shallow, aloof teenage dialog. Whereas the Bella in the novel is a 18 going on 40 type of woman, who is way more mature than her age, after spending most of her childhood raising and caring for her erratic mother.

Kirsten Stewart was a terrible choice to represent the character from the book, but a perfect choice for who they turned the character into in the screenplay.

The more they tried to stick to the source material, the worse it got, because so much of the nuance was lost. Bad casting. Bad acting. Bad screenplay.

I thought the acting was fine, too. Everyone trying to “explain” the movie by insulting the author or talking about how she was a fat Mormon are just fucking weirdos.

It really is hard to explain how something so awkward and cheesy can be so good, but here’s my two cents:

1. It was made for teenage girls in the late 2000’s. Back when we all wanted something to live for, but we were in middle school. And we liked to think we were edgy. It was the definition of the right thing at the right time.
2. It’s prohibited love but PG-13. That stuff is crack for this target audience.
3. It’s accessible. It doesn’t take a lot of cinema knowledge to understand, if at all. It’s not one bit complicated, but there are some complex brokenness in the characters if you really think about it.
4. It has this crazy unique atmosphere that can’t be replicated and it only belongs to Twilight. The cyan, paramore and linkin park in the soundtrack but so is Debussy, the pacific northwest, the original music, the rain. The minimalistic vampire house. I could keep going.
5. It really took YA Fantasy to a different level that hadn’t been seen since Harry Potter. The cult following was insane back then.",titanicis

I don't know the entirety of the plot, I think they shot some other sequences on a different set but we were shooting basically a rampage scene where someone comes into a building and hunts down a bunch of people within. 

And the gist of the conversation was that all of us on the crew other than the director thought the video was supposed to be intentionally campy and it was making references to cheesey/bad/camp action movies intentionally.

It's finally showtime and I can't even begin to describe the disparity in excitement between my date and I as the movie progresses. She losing her mind at every little thing and detail and I'm going back and forth between suppressing laughter and wondering if this movie was for real.

I brave my way through it, and we get back to the car to leave and she's all excited about driving, and proceeds to drive like a maniac, like Edward did in that one scene, and I'm legitimately fearing for my life as we make it back to her place.

Almost 5,000 pages of writing, and every line of it is unironically, comically terrible.

It’s only when the series went viral with teens and the numbers went high enough did it merit studio attention.

To me it’s a larger thing about the book world. With books most automatically assume it’s a higher escelon of medium and anything that gets popualr must be due to its quality. This is not the case. So many terrible books that simply fulfill a more base need get tons of attention despite being quite bad.

In fact often when I’m reading new literature I don’t take a positive review at face value and instead try and look for the actual answer.

Fifty Shades is another example and as a mystery novel fan I find myself constantly stumbling into godawful, terrible books that were supposedly “amazing.” And the years best seller.",missanthropocenex

- The band My Chemical Romance was created by frontman Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier after wintessing the 9/11 attacks.  It apparently inspired them to live life for their dreams and they started this band.    
- Stephanie Meyer then uses music from My Chemical Romance as she's litening to it, that inspired her to create the Twlight books, which go on to become hit (and shitty) movies.  I haven't read the books but I assume they are equally shitty.    
- Fan fiction of Twilight was then written by E. L. James, whcih ends up becoming the book.... 50 Shades of Gray.    

So.... if 9/11 doesn't happen, then My Chemical Romance doesn't form and create their music, which means Stephanie Meyer isn't inspired to write Twlight, and thus fan fiction by E. L. James isn't created into 50 Shades of Gray.

One of the funny things about vampires in Twilight that I don't think they ever really talk about is how even the vegetarians aren't harmless. They put on a show with Jasper attacking Bella and talk about it a lot, but they're never actually shown to kill a human. I don't think they go into it too much in the movies, but the only vampires in the series that never murder anyone out of bloodlust are Carlisle, Rosalie, and Bella (because she's the super special main character).

Obviously there is some objective standard of ""good"" in art. It's how we recognize things like bad dialog, acting that doesn't fit the part, bad direction etc. There are people who like something, make it their identities, and then die on hills arguing that there are no flaws in the thing they like. That can be a bit annoying.   


Conversely, enjoyment of art is subjective. Many reasons above and beyond the actual piece of media (how my day is going, what I recently watched, what I'm craving, what are the problems/interests in my life right now etc.) will impact my personal enjoyment. People need to stop attacking other people for their personal enjoyment.  


  Finally, there is the element of who it is made for. I bet most 12-16 year olds of any gender have taste that is unrefined. This leads to lots of meh media developing huge fan bases. It's definitely a phenomenon that adult men target what many women and girls like while never addressing the mediocre and bad media they themselves enjoyed. That behaviour is pretty weird and a huge red flag. In summation. 


The Kevin Federline album is objectively terrible music. He is a mediocre performer and didn't purchse quality song writing (or is bad at it). If someone likes it, good for them, rock on!


Or more to the point here - Twilight speaks to very specific age group of people who have started focusing on the idea of relationships, and at an age where people desperately crave some validation of self by being wanted by someone else.

People are so self absorbed with a product they feel the need to defend said product from other peoples opinions. Why is it bad that people dont like twilight and strongly voice that opinion? 

ANSWER: I say self absorbed because criticizing the product is treated as an attack on the person themselves thus it is bad to criticize art they like 

If I watch sharknado or the room and talk about its bad quality why is this a bad thing.....?  People hate watch all sorts of popular male oriented franchises like; transformers, fastxfurious, expendables, Steven Segall movies. etc. People talk shit all day about them but I dont think thats a problem for you.

I believe that there is this bias whenever women are involved in groups that automatically makes people frame any situation in a way to give these women the most protection. 

So when a popular female franchise gets criticized for being low quality the bias kicks in and anyone that displeases this group is perceived as,

 "" Salty old men hate watching it to bitch on the internet ""

The character is whiny,  like people criticized AOTC Anakin for being,  but it was actually the performance that role needed.

When I read it seemed like, I was convinced that Stephanie was convinced she was Bella, and it was like it was a book that wasn't supposed to be published. And you're like reading her... her sort of sexual fantasy about some, and especially when she says it was based on a dream and it's like, *""Oh I've had this dream about this real sexy guy,""* and she just writes this book about it. And like some things about Edward are so specific, I was just convinced that... this woman is mad, she's completely mad and she's in love with her own fictional creation. And like sometimes you feel uncomfortable reading this thing and I think a lot of people feel that it is, in the same way it's kinda voyeuristic and... it's kinda a sick pleasure in a lot of ways.

There isn't a single universally accepted term for a movie that's unintentionally campy. However, here are a few terms commonly used to describe this phenomenon:

Naïve Camp: This term is used by film theorists to describe unintentional camp. It refers to situations where a movie, originally intended to be serious or dramatic, ends up being perceived by audiences as campy due to its excessive elements, melodrama, or awkward acting. Think of B-movies or older melodramas that have become cult classics due to their unintentional campiness.

Unintentional Camp: This is a more straightforward term that simply describes a movie that unintentionally falls into the category of camp.

So-Bad-It's-Good: This term applies to movies that are objectively bad in terms of filmmaking or acting, but become entertaining due to their very flaws. These movies often have elements of unintentional camp that contribute to their ""so-bad-it's-good"" appeal.

Here are some additional points to consider:

The line between intentional and unintentional camp can be blurry. Sometimes, filmmakers might embrace camp aesthetics while still aiming to create a serious story.
The perception of camp is subjective. What one person finds unintentionally campy, another might appreciate for its dramatic flair.
Overall, while there isn't a single perfect term, ""naïve camp"" or ""unintentional camp"" are good options to describe movies that are unintentionally campy but still hold a certain appeal for audiences.",geccles

A time when his first wife dropped out of acting to raise the family, while Newman spent her family money to go to Yale for acting, then dropping out and moving to New York to get a broadway job.

Actors are paid based on what their agents individually negotiate for them and based on their perceived reputation and value to the client (which isn't necessarily earned). Newman and Hackman were not only A-list in the mid 90's, but were essentially screen legends. Both had twice as many Oscar wins as Sarandon and Newman also had twice as many nominations. Based on that alone I wouldn't expect them to all be paid the same. Beyond that though, the perceived value of Newman and Hackman, whether correct or not, was greater than that of Sarandon at the time. 

Even if you ignored all that, an actor may be paid more than their costars simply because a role was written specifically for them and it gives them a better negotiating position. Kirsten Dunst may be worth more than Jennifer Lawrence if the role she's being hired for *needs* her and the role Lawrence is playing could be played by any number of people.

The statistics of that time are no where near where we are today. Here’s another thing why is she complaining about anything she is worth 50 million. This society is so detached from reality to even run a story like this it is ridiculous. The only real problem with wage gap is not between the sexes it is between corporate execs and the workers. All this story is doing is trying to divide the masses so that we don’t unite and take care of the real issues in this world.

Susan had 57.   They weren't separated by a huge gap in experience. 

Paul Newman's lifetime adjusted gross box office was $5,412,589,800 over 83 acting roles. 

Susan is currently at an adjusted $3,008,508,900 with 153 acting roles. 

Obviously, Paul Newman or the vehicles he acted in at least depending on director and writer was a larger box office draw and because of this it's easy to understand why he was paid more.   It was very kind of him to give her some of his pay - but for anyone to imagine he didn't deserve more pay for his involvment in Twilight would be wrong. 

A little more research shows that Gene Hackman was the other male star that was paid the same as Newman,  and that is the kicker.  Hackman has 100 acting credits and has barely broken the 3 billion mark in total box office gross for films he's appeared in.   To say HE was worthy of being paid the same as Newman in Twighlight isn't even fair.    This was either sexism, or negotiation.   Who knows.  

I don't like to fall into the trend that people are deserved equal pay just because of their sex - I happen to work with a female 3D Visualist at our architecture firm.   I come along with 15 years experience and a large client list that I've produced for.   She comes along with 7 years experience and obviously a smaller volume of experience.   She is about the same age as me, and I would argue in a heartbeat if she stomped her feet and demanded equal pay for the job based on anything but her experience.  

But Paul Newman is a nice guy.  Probably nicer than me.   Love his movies.

Is the idea behind fixing the wage gap to bring women's pay up to that of men's or reduce men's pay to that of women's? 

In this case it's claimed that the studio was underpaying Susan Sarandon and everybody, applauds Newman for giving her some of his salary. But isn't the correct fix to demand a pay raise from the studio?

Same in the case of the male BBC presenters that took massive pay cuts when it was released that women we're paid less. Women's pay was not increased, Men's pay was massively decreased and everybody applauded those ""nice"" men (I'd call them idiotic men) and moved on. Yet the corporation responsible for underpaying women is the only winner in the scenario.

So which is it, fix the wage gap to benefit corporations and screw men or fix the wage gap to benefit women and screw corporations.",rankkor

When people think of great actors Paul Newman is definitely one of them.  Gene Hackman was a star in many major blockbusters.

Sarandon is just mediocre and not a draw.  

Now if Meryl Streep told this story, Jodie Foster (in her prime), Julia Roberts or other big name draws/talents had a similar story that would be something worth noting.

The fact is that nobody is worth more than people are willing to pay them.  Male or female.  If a producer thinks for 1 second that paying an actress the same as an actor in the same movie will make him/her more money, then they will pay them that much.",None

I'm all for equal pay for an equal job but the nature of that job is really fluid. I don't know which of these actors have the best chops, the greatest portfolio not their contribution to the movie.  I haven't seen it and am (I believe) fairly impartial.

I would also like to state that there is a reason some actors/actresses get paid much more while their co stars get paid very little, you don't cast Anthony Hopkins and pay him the same as his unknown costar even if they are playing equal parts. 

So with this context I would ask, does she deserve to be paid the same? Did she do as good of a job? Was her role as important, did she have more or less screen time, does she have as much experience as the other two, is her portfolio as large? I'm all for equal pay for an Equal job but some of these are hard to nail down to an exact equal ratio.

 *Side note, if it's important to get paid fairly for how hard/ how well you do your job should we be looking at people like streamers who just video games all day making tons whole someone else slaves away just to keep afloat?

Let’s not pretend that men and women are see as equal value to one and other, either. People will bend over backwards to assert that the actor is far more famous, so he deserves more. They don’t acknowledge the fame of the actress. Examples of actresses earning more are always, like this, of TOP actresses of today, not a mid level actor vs a mid level actress.

They also completely discount opportunities available. Actors have more chances to star in lead roles in big films than actresses have. There’s not even a lot of female lead films to begin with. It’s going to be harder to make yourself as well known when you’re always the supporting character.

Exactly this. Essentially there is all this clamour ""to fix"" things and have *equality of outcome* whether you deserve it or not. Instead of giving everybody the same chance to succeed. 

Maybe they chose Susan Sarandon as an actor *because she cost less than other female leads.* Is it wrong to choose somebody because they might work for less than another *woman*?

Is it discriminatory to have a *supporting actors* rather than *lead actors* because lead actors might happen to get paid more??

I would challenge anyone I know, myself included, to name as many actors and actresses as possible and see how the gender ratio plays out. But it's a broken machine that feeds itself. You pay male stars more, so you put them as the ""leads"", so they get more exposure, so you want them in another film, but now they cost more, rinse, wash, and repeat. It's definitely a problem, and I think that your last point is dead on. Hollywood definitely needs to write stronger female characters, but that would require more females in the creative side of things. Which Hollywood also isn't great at.

That's why I'm ok with people hyping movies because of gender or race of the people behind them. Because, yeah, in a perfect world it wouldn't matter at all. But we're not even close to that world. So anything that helps us get there is probably a worthwhile thing.",JPBen

He seems to have maintained something of a cordial relations at least his kids, of not his wife. Also, his second wife was Joanne Woodward, not Jessica.

Both of the articles are written by Shawn Levy, who also wrote the book the articles are based on. (He oddly references his own book in the article as ""a new book about to be published in America"".) It is not an authorized biography, but I didn't see anyone calling it inaccurate. I don't know much about Newman so I have no idea if any or all of the claims in the book are true or well-sourced, but I am wary of that combination of salacious detail and scant attribution. 

Shawn Levy is a film critic for The Oregonian. He is the only source I saw for the ""guilty as hell"" quote and certainly that quote is presented in the article as a response to these stories, but it could not have been because the author [never interviewed Newman](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/08/AR2009050803704.html).

They're camps that are made available to kids with chronic and life threatening illnesses, free of cost to the camper and the parents.

They're all remarkable, too. The staff is trained to the gills in terms of safety, and a heavy emphasis is placed on emotional development for children who spend much of their lives in the hospital.

I think the gist of it is that it's a series of summer camps designed for terminally ill children to go to during the summer completely free to charge and tailored for them so that they can spend a summer just being normal kids and forget about their illness as much as possible. 

When I was in the fraternity as an active member my chapter was in a poor state, but I and many of my brothers did our best to improve things, so now my chapter at SFSU is able to send brothers to the camps every summer to volunteer. Our closest camp that we send active brothers to is here in California at Painted Turtle and they always say it's a life changing experience to give back and volunteer there. Very proud of what Paul Newman started and the all of the efforts my fraternity does to donate to that great cause.

They always talk about how life changing volunteering there is.

One thing we've really improved upon was our philanthropy donations which go to SeriousFun. When I was active we'd be lucky to donate $500 a year, but now the chapter donates between $3000-$5000 every year which is really an accomplishment for a chapter our size, just under 50 guys, and a greek life at SFSU that is very small. Of course we want to improve on that and one thing I'm working on is our alumni relations so they will donate to the chapter and SeriousFun. Being able to donate $10,000 one of these years would really be great and a personal point of pride knowing where my chapter came from. Slow and steady, one day we'll get there.

No they don't. That's part of if, but there are lots of overpaid actors. Perception and general star power seems to play a big role just as it does with all commercial art industries. Pick your commercial art industry and the pay varies dramatically person to person based on reputation, even if that reputation is overblown. Not all illustrators are paid the same to do a New Yorker cover. Not all photographers are paid the same to shoot a Vogue cover. They negotiate a fee in large part based on their reputation and past work. That fee may not necessarily translate into a proportional uptick in magazine sales. 

In this case, whether deserved or not based on box office numbers, Hackman and Newman had more impressive reputations and star power. I mean for christ sake, Newman is one of the biggest names in a century and Hackman is a legend in his own right. I'm not surprised that they could demand more money. ",None

De Niro earned his set-salary over the years. He's a 'veteran'. It works the same way in professional sports; older players who obviously aren't as good as young talented rookies get paid 10x as much because of their years of experience. They've earned an expected or minimum salary. ",Airforce987

Get real man.

Edit:  Just to make this undeniable.  Here are the total numbers for those 2 artists.  Please scroll down to adjusted average.

Apparently Robert asked to borrow his one of a kind car for one reason or another, then when he went to give it back he found a similar looking model and had it compacted at a junk yard and just left it at Newman’s house with the moving guys instructed to bring the real one around once he came home and the joke happened. I guess years went by after this and then at some point Robert came home home and in the middle of his brand new marble foyer was the cubed hunk of junk sitting there. He said he had no idea how they got it inside - they must have taken the doors off while he was away and used a fork lift or something. Also Paul’s House was in like Maryland or somewhere on the East Coast and Robert was across the country. When he finally got some movers to get it out of his house he said it was so heavy it left a big square indent in his fancy Italian marble. He had a professional metal artist come take a
look at it and the artist turned it into the most god awe full piece of junk statue he’d ever seen. Then he sent back to Newman’s house and I guess it became a part of his garden. He laughed and said that the best part was that this whole thing happened over several years and not one word ever passed between them about it. All the way up to his death.

The movie posters etc often don't feature the actors. So, I'd discount Sarandon in James and the Giant Peach, and I'd also discount Cars for Newman, if you looked at his total box office. 

2) I was comparing like for like over a period of 10 years, inflation was irrelevant - appply it to both or not at all. 

3) Because an actor's appeal changes dramatically over the years.  How's Lindsey Lohan's star appeal right now? 4 was arbitrary but if you want to go back to colour of money and include everything then 

Newman - 6 films, $125 million gross, $21 million average

Sarandon - 16 films, $436 million gross, $27 million average

The only argument here is that Newman deserved more money as he brought in more money. That hadn't been true for the best part of 20 years. 

Newman's total box office was probably higher than that, that's missing Cool Hand Luke, for one. But no one is saying he's not a huge star, but his big hits where almost 30 years before.

So does he deserve more money for simply being Paul Newman? Maybe

For just being in my favourite movie The Sting? Yup

But for being a name that would bring more money to that movie? Clearly not. It wasn't the 70s

people go to these movies to see chris hemsworth as thor. we see chris as thor now. people go to see chris evans as cap. people definitely go to see mark as the hulk. 

is scarjo known for anything besides being a pretty face and nice body? 

no. 

she got 20 million for being a chick. if the avengers roster was instead made up of 6 chicks and 1 dude, there is no way each girl would have gotten 20 million dollars.

But if we're talking about opening movies, then you're missing a key point. It's not that Sarandon or any other woman COULDN'T open a movie, it's that they DIDN'T. 

In 1998, when Twighlight was released, less than 15 of the top 100 grossing films had a woman as the lead. Now, you might see that as  proof that men sell a movie better.

Do all this, and it still gets you only to The Rock levels of acting, which is really just being yourself when the camera starts. If we're talking about complex roles, characters, then it gets insanely harder . I'm not even talking about extreme emotions like crying or yelling etc. Little, super subtle things really add up.

Once I find it, and the limeade that the first responder to your post mentioned, I will be comparing them to my favorite brand of fruit juices, the Simply Orange Juice Co. brand.

I would be surprised of you have not tasted at least one of the 20+ Simply Orange juice types. They are all amazing. I will recommend that you never buy one 11.5oz containers found in convince stores as the 59oz bottles, found in grocery stores is usually less than $2 more; the little little guys are massively marked up.

Lots of bruises, needles every few days of my life, but overall its extremely well managed, and doesn't impact my life much these days (im 25 now). The large majority of the children that go to camp (at least the ones I've worked at) have campers that are at least moderately medically stable. For example, most campers with cancer that come are in remission.

So yeah, absolutely, with a big caveat. They all have pretty robust medical centers, and usually climate controlled, comfortable cabins. So outdoor time is available but generally less than what you would expect at most summer camps. Also, the camps are all extremely regimented on programming times. There's not much free time to laze around as it were, as there is a big focus on developing skills of campers through events like archery, woodshop, and teambuilding/climbing.

If you lump a whole group together and treat them as one entity then you encourage them to do the same thing. Then we end up with feminists fighting men and MRAs fighting women. People care much more about winning fights than coming up with mutually beneficial solutions.

You're a victim of that too. You're sick of being told what a bad person you are purely for being male and that makes the people on the other side sound very reasonable. A lot of them are. But a lot of them are just looking for a fight. That's true for both sides.

Feminists wanted equality. They got it (for the most part) then the movement kept going. Then there were a lot of people calling themselves feminists but the only people who felt like more needed to be done were the ones who didn't want equality but superiority. Feminism was promoted as a good thing because it had achieved good things and that allowed bad people to use it to justify their actions. Men started becoming oppressed and responded with their own movement but I promise you that has the exact same flaws as feminism and buying into that (or any other) ideology is just adding fuel to the fire.

Most women have completely reasonable beliefs about sexism. They've been fed lies, some of which they believe, but they're just as reasonable as you are. Don't let the extremists turn you into one yourself because then all you do is serve as proof that men and women are enemies. And don't think you're immune. No one is.

I am saying that he was very probably perceived as worth more whether or not that was true by the numbers.

> But for being a name that would bring more money to that movie? Clearly not. It wasn't the 70s

I'd argue that the kind of movie that gives top billing to ""Newman. Hackman. Sarandon."" is trying to appeal to people who want to see Hollywood legends in a movie.

> Newman - 6 films, $125 million gross, $21 million average

> Sarandon - 16 films, $436 million gross, $27 million average

Yeah, but did Sarandon star in all of them? Being a non-billed actor in a blockbuster shouldn't count.

The thing is that there are many ways to massage this data to make whatever point we want to make.

I was buying movie tickets in 1998 and while Susan Sarandon was a well-known and respected actress, she didn't have the perceived star power of Hollywood legends Newman, Brando, Eastwood, Pacino, De Niro, etc. And she wasn't commercial enough in her choice of roles to get the kind of pay grade as your Julia Robertses or Sandra Bullocks.",saltlets

lol, the top review from August 24th, 2014:

>I wish I could give this product 10 stars. I really do. You see, I have been in a very unfulfilling relationship for 2 years. I started out happy, but gradually, I lost that loving feeling. The trouble was that his deeply passionate affection for me had not abated in the least; if anything, Brian had fallen so much in love that he would cry every time he said, ""I love you,"" which was a few dozen times per day. This may have contributed to my growing apathy. I am a caring person and I DO love him (like a brother); I certainly didn't want to break his heart. This is why I have remained in the relationship for so long. I have wracked my brains trying to come up with a way to make him want to leave me. His mother had me over for Thanksgiving dinner. She had flown her long-lost brother over from Poland and had spent days preparing a sumptuous feast. Right after Grace was said, I climbed up on the table, pulled down my panties, and took a massive dump on the sage-infused turkey and stuffing. His family has shunned me; he not only stayed with me, he also shunned THEM in return. Even after I doused all his clothes in gasoline and put them, his state-of-the-art home media system, and the teddy bear his deceased grandmother had given him as a boy in his beautifully-restored Shelby Cobra 427 SC and threw in a burning book of matches, he didn't even get mad! He smiled, pulled me close, and said that I was the only thing he couldn't bear to lose. Well, heck, after tat, what was I going to do? So cut to last night. We had just sat down to watch ""King of the Hill"" (the one where Boomhauer gets his heart broken by that dang ol' rich girl-I love that one), and it was going to be a casual dinner night-Tostitos and dip. I had seen this salsa queso dip at publix and thought it would be tasty. I handed Brian the jar and tore open the chips bag. He unscrewed the lid. An unearthly stench immediately assaulted our nostrils. I spontaneously blew grits into the brand new bag of chips. My vomit and the substance in the jar were indiscernible. Same look, same odor. Brian flew into a rage. ""WHAT THE H E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS ARE YOU TRYING TO DO-KILL US BOTH????"" I shook my head in confusion, unable to answer. He strode into my bedroom, grabbed the few belongings of his that were I my place, and shouted, ""DONT EVER LET ME SEE YOUR WICKED FACE AGAIN!"" That's it. He's gone. Thank you, Newman's Own, even though my pet ferret got into the stuff and licked a little of it, then promptly fell over dead.",ACanticle4Needledick

Edit: I don't want anyone thinking starbucks is specialty coffee. It's totally not. Their *reserve* line is. Although I can name probably 20 better specialty roasters off the top of my head. Their reserve shops are really the cool thing about them. They have that starbucks money to throw at it to make it super cool. I think Seattle and Chicago both have one.

It's not about second chances or a person changing. The fact that you changed over time doesn't mean we can say ""Oh well, those things you did in your 20s don't matter anymore"" or what have you. In the original example, I disagree that you could say it doesn't matter what Newman did in his 20s, or that we can't judge based on that. We absolutely should judge based on that, just not *only* that. Discarding the 20s makes as much sense as discarding the 30s, or the 40s, or the 50s, and so on. Eventually, it boils down to just discarding the parts that are uncomfortable, and minimizing their significance.

To take an extreme example, if I murdered someone in university, but went on to be a Nobel laureate whose efforts save millions of lives, you shouldn't just ignore the fact that I am a murderer. Saving lives doesn't wash away the murder. But you also shouldn't ignore the lives saved. Things should be evaluated in their totality. In this example, I am a murderer, but I also saved people. Does that make me a good person? That depends on who is judging it, but the question should be presented with both facts. Someone should not argue ""Of course he's a good person, he saved all those lives! He was young when that other thing happened, you can't hold it against him.""",fillydashon

I saw a reddit post earlier today, saying that we're currently experiencing a Renaissance. The more I think about it, that poster may be right. The changes in attitudes are happening so fast and so furious right now. Who knows what we'll look back on 20 years from now, and the things we just accept without a second thought, we'll ask ourselves, ""Selves, why did we let those crazy things happen?""

Ok, enough introspection. We both agree that Paul was a fine specimen of manhood, and I'm okay with that.

It's just a general notion that men are more valuable in acting. For this reason, I think all paychecks should be made public so that the moviegoers can decide who's huge paycheck they really want to support.

I wonder about salaries in The Post. Meryl was clearly the lead, had more lines, more scenes, the better actor based on industry rating (both nominations & awards), more experienced (both in years prof. acting and number of scenes), but for equality reasons, I bet Tom Hanks made the same paycheck because he's perceived as more valuable from the start.

Take Annie Leibowitz for example. Her fee for a Vanity Fair cover is hundreds if not thousands of times higher than most of the photographers the magazine commissions. Does her photography sell thousands of percent more magazines than other talented photographers with less of a reputation? Definitely, 100% not. But they pay her a great deal more nonetheless. The same is true of prominent illustrators, industrial designers, graphic artists, writers etc. This may not be fair or even smart business, but I don't think discrimination plays a big role.

You do know that Stone is an Academy Award winner, right? And starred in highly acclaimed movies like The Help and La La Land? We’re not talking some nobody here.

And btw, “perceived value” is literally what I’m arguing. It’s not like the wage gap is caused by some accountant in payroll saying, “Ah, they hired the woman! That’ll save us a few thousand because we can pay her less!” No. It’s because we subconsciously perceive women and their accomplishments as having less value than men with the same qualifications.

And when you say ""Julia Robertses or Sandra Bullocks"" you mean ""Julia Roberts and Sanra Bullock"" as they were probably the only two women of that era who'd get top dollar, compared to a long list of men. 

And as for the data, I can only compare the films that are there. And as for your ""massage this data"", there is no way to massage it that makes Paul Newman a bigger commercial draw at that time. None. That is all the argument is about. The perception is exactly the problem, that people didn't see women as such a big commercial draw, but that's because Hollywood was run by men, who paid women less and didn't give female led movies anywhere near as much opportunity as men. 

That's the like for like that's important; it's pretty hard to become a Hollywood legend like ""Newman, Brando, Eastwood, Pacino, De Niro, etc."" if you hardly ever get top billing. Sarandon did twice for big films; Thelma and Louise and Dead Man Walking - those were huge commerical and critical successes. So, surely she goes on to get top billing and the biggest paycheque for numerous other films, right? Nope, that's it. That's her lot, because she's a woman and she was getting older. ",boldkingcole

I looked at Nestle as they're more or less in the same line of business and they had an operating income of $13.16 billion on $89.8 billion in revenue. If I'm doing the math correctly, that puts them at a 15% profit. Newman's Own has $30 million in profit on $600 million in sales. That's a 5% profit. That doesn't seem obviously reasonable to me.

>the CEO made $295k in 2013 according to the article. no freakin way is any other CEO of a company that big making that little.

My employer had 10x Newman's Own's revenue, the CEO certainly doesn't make $2.95 million in total compensation (as it's a publicly traded company this is known information.)

>why do people always feel the need to try and tear down something good?

It's not tearing anything down. It's making an accurate assessment of the situation. People seem to have a less critical eye of an enterprise that is ""non-profit"". However such enterprises are not necessarily doing something nice for the community or society. Plenty of people at non-profit businesses are taking huge personal profits and there's no obvious reason to ignore that fact.",wang_li

If women were as much of a box office draw as their male counterparts they would be paid the same or more depending on their fame, the awards they have under their belt, their perceived standing, how much their previous films have made at the box office, their talent, their experience in the industry, how good of an agent they have, etc....There are many factors that you have not considered. It is not just ""famous male vs. famous female"". 

It has nothing to do with gender. An actor is paid based upon the money they will draw to the box office. Film is a business. That is a fact. Now I'm done debating with someone who is clearly uneducated in the matter.

And when you say ""Julia Robertses or Sandra Bullocks"" you mean ""Julia Roberts and Sanra Bullock"" as they were probably the only two women of that era who'd get top dollar, compared to a long list of men.

Hollywood starring roles are a terrible place to look for systemic wage discrimination because compensation is almost entirely dependent on box office draw. You can argue that this reflects the sexism of society itself, but it is beyond the pay grade of Hollywood to change those attitudes. If they thought they could make more money by having 50/50 representation in all genres, they would do it in a second.

Also, where's this long list of men who were being paid $20 million per movie? Certainly Hackman and Newman weren't. Julia Roberts was the 2nd highest paid actor in the 1990s. 

> And as for the data, I can only compare the films that are there. And as for your ""massage this data"", there is no way to massage it that makes Paul Newman a bigger commercial draw at that time. None.

Of course there is. You eliminate the box office results of Sarandon's movies where she wasn't the star. That's Little Women gone.

> That is all the argument is about. The perception is exactly the problem, that people didn't see women as such a big commercial draw, but that's because Hollywood was run by men, who paid women less and didn't give female led movies anywhere near as much opportunity as men.

They gave female led movies plenty of opportunity, but female leads only worked in certain genres. Action movies were male-dominated, and action movies with female leads were flops or underperformed. People tried to make Geena Davis into an action star, they tried making Demi Moore into an action star. But people went to watch Bruce Willis and Arnie.

> That's the like for like that's important; it's pretty hard to become a Hollywood legend like ""Newman, Brando, Eastwood, Pacino, De Niro, etc."" if you hardly ever get top billing. Sarandon did twice for big films; Thelma and Louise and Dead Man Walking - those were huge commerical and critical successes. So, surely she goes on to get top billing and the biggest paycheque for numerous other films, right? Nope, that's it. That's her lot, because she's a woman and she was getting older.

This is nonsensical. Top billing also requires that you be a main character, not a supporting character.

Sarandon obviously did not decide to go the Julia Roberts route and maximize box office returns. She did the big Grisham movie in 1994 (got top billing over Tommy Lee Jones), and then picked more prestigious but less commercial roles. Dead Man Walking was a critical success but barely made a dint at the box office. It took in $38 million at the box office on a budget of $11 million, so there's absolutely no room there to give Sarandon a $10+ million payday.

I made one assumption, that you were spouting off a meme to be funny, the truth seems to be much sadder. It seems you actually think communism is a good idea, and that is just misguided. And yes, the results of socialism/communism are very predictable. ",rg90184

You asked a general question, I gave a general answer. 

One self-titled superhero movie isn't a good example to refute my statement. A Wonder Woman film has been in demand and heavily anticipated for *years* by fans the world over, and it came out during a time where superhero films are extremely popular, *and* the character was introduced during the climax of Batman vs Superman, which all but guaranteed Wonder Woman would be a smash-hit initially, regardless of how good or bad it may have ended up actually being. It was also called *Wonder Woman*; everyone who bought tickets for this movie knew they were going to watch a movie about Diana and not Steve Trevor.  Compare this to Annihilation. Great movie by most accounts, with a mostly-female cast and household name Natalie Portman as the lead - tanked. 

If the next DC movie that came out was titled ""Superman"" but also featured Wonder Woman, who do you think would get paid more? The actor playing the title character or the co-star who isn't?

What kind of life we'd want to live; they even set relationship expectations for many.

Having said that, men are bigger box office draws as leads than women because *everyone* can appreciate an idealized(fake) man. Strong, tall, bold, handsome, suave, determined; a loyal friend and an unimaginable lover, etc - I mean, look at Dwayne Johnson. Women want him and men want to be him, and because of this, studios will pay top billing for him. There is a long list of male leads that have carried that crown - Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Sean Connery, Wesley Snipes, Denzel Washington, Mark Wahlberg Matt Damon - just to name a handful. Their individual star power has waxed and waned over time but any of their names on a movie poster would have meant significantly more ticket sales and DVD purchases than had they not been. Idealized men have a universal appeal between the sexes.

The same cannot be said of the idealized woman; primarily because there isn't one. There is no female caricature that captures the ""best"" qualities of a woman because right now no one can agree with what those qualities are. Even if you were to take a category of generic ""heroic"" qualities and apply them to both a male and female character, audiences wouldn't interpret the the same way. Those qualities tend to be oriented in a realm of masculinity, so when those traits are emerging from a female, not everyone responds as positively as they would had they come from a man. Even today, at the current peak of female empowerment, a heroic female is still disorienting to some audiences when compared to a heroic man.

Maybe things will change - perhaps they are changing right now. But I think it's going to be awhile before anyone can say definitively that the game has changed. That audiences have suddenly become enlightened; somehow managing to cast aside engrained gender-bias that have existed since time immeasurable within the past 5 years. ",None

Yes, that's why I picked Nestle instead of General Electric.

>that's not how compensation works.

It's not linear, but the point was that the CEO of Newman's Own's salary is quite high. In fact it's higher than the base salary of the CEO of the company I work for. Add in the additional compensation and my CEO only earns about 3x even though the company is ten times larger.

There are a thousand variables that cause some movies to be successful over others.  It's entirely possible that Nobody's Fool would not have made nearly as much money without Paul Newman.  It is also possible that those films were not marketed as much/as well/to the wrong demographic. It is also possible that Susan Sarandon's movies made more b. A lot can influence these variables beyond the start of the movie - and I suspect that Hollywood executives would understand these variables when discussing pay. 

It is good to put some numbers to these names - however it seems irresponsible without doing a deep dive into the context of each movie's revenue and the potential influence that each star would have had in adding to the economics of those movies.

So bottom line - Paul Newman could have very well added much more than Susan Sarandon - or he might have not.  These numbers certainly don't comprise the whole picture.   ",thomashefe

Name me a socialist state that hasn't devolved into people starving, bread lines, and crippling poverty. They all have, it's a trend and therefore predictable. 

> you aren't OK with the government functioning as a part socialist entity like it does now? 

No, I'm not. I'd prefer government to be as small and fragmented as possible while still functioning. Federal govt only being there to facilitate local govt and basic infrastructure and leaving the rest to the private sector. 

> Do you know just how many things they control and provide?

I'm well aware, and that is horrifying to have all that centralized power and control.

He was paid 1500 times what she was because sexism? First, I need a source for the 1500 times claim.  

Second, pay is negotiable. Her agent didn't represent her well. There are thousands of boxes you need to check before jumping to sexism. There are thousands of explanations you need to discredit before jumping to sexism.     

And if you know anything about business then you'd know that someone who can gross 2.5 times another person is worth more than 2.5 times that person, simply because you get larger margins the more you exceed overhead.  

The only way I will even consider sexism in this case is if we say the general public likes actors over actresses (as evidenced by there only being 2 in the top 20 on that list), which likely has some truth to it. But then it's really not the industry's fault for paying men more, and is the rational thing to do to meet demand. But then if you're going to blame the demand side of the equation you have to prove the general populous irrationally favours male leads over female leads in movies, which would be an arrogant thing to do.

I don't know the context and doubt that number.  

The business argument is simple arithmetic: 

Suppose I want to make a movie. I have everything planned out and think it will cost me $50M. But stupid me, I forgot about the lead role! I narrow my search down to 2 options:   

Actor A is the most popular actor on the planet (like a Robert Downey Jr. right now) The person attracts crowds no matter what movie they make. They have a huge following. I estimate that if I cast this actor estimate I will make $150M in revenue from the movie. So my profit (without paying this actor) would be $150M - $50M = $100M.   

Actor B is lesser known. More often a support caster or a B movie star, like a Kevin Bacon. If I cast this actor I estimate I will make $60M in revenue. So my profit (without paying this actor) would be $60M - $50M = $10M.


With actor A I make $100M in profit, and with actor B I make $10M in profit. Suppose actor A would cost $50M to star in the movie, while actor B would cost $5M to star in the movie.  

I pay the $50. This way I make $50M in profit instead of $5M. I am more than happy to pay actor A 10x as much because it generates more profit for me.  

So to your point, *any intelligent businessperson* would say an employee who grosses 2.5x their colleagues is worth more than 2.5x their colleagues, because there are base-level overhead costs that you have to pay off before you turn a profit. In this case actor A grosses $150M while actor B grosses $60M. Actor A grosses 2.5 as much as actor B, but the businessperson would be an idiot to not pay more than 2.5x as much for their services.  

As for the 1500 I need the source. Seriously. Maybe I can run the numbers like I just did now. If we can pick RDJ over Kevin Bacon and it's not sexism, we shouldn't automatically jump to sexism when one person happens to be a woman.

That's where we disagree. 

>When capitalism swings open the door for profits and greed in the healthcare industry, people die. 

Incorrect, At this very second, one million Canadians are waiting for medically necessary procedures. Unlike in American where simple procedures can be performed within just a few days from the initial appointment, Canadian patients are put at the bottom of an extensive waiting list where they are expected to wait an approximate 9.3 weeks to see a specialist. If you think that’s bad, in 2016 patients needing to see a neurosurgeon waited an upmost of 46.9 weeks. To some patients, this is a death sentence.

>Also, you kept saying mixed like it meant nothing. 

I'm pointing out that these economies NEED capitalism to fund their exorbitant social programs instead of leaving those services to the private sector to innovate and compete.

>Healthcare is meaningless if the majority of citizens are priced out of all but basic services. 

Incorrect, while I'll agree that at the moment healthcares costs are inflated, services do need to be able to operate at a net gain or they will fail. In a socialized system the govt is in a constant state of bailing them out on the taxpayer's dime. Also, expanding medicare to all (as Sanders wants to do) would cripple the taxpayers beyond recognition. If I recall correctly he wasn't opposed to people having a 90% tax rate to pay for it.

To your point, do people feel they can get away with paying *one* woman less than *one* man? In this case yes, and it clearly worked. They're not a charity, and the goal is to minimize cost. But is it sexism? Obviously not. Let me put it to you this way:  

Producer: Hi Actor. Would you like to take a role for $10M?   
Actor/Agent: No. I want at least $30M  
<negotiations ensue>  
They settle on $25M.    

Same scenario:  
Hi Actress. Would you like to take a role for $10M?  
Actor/Agent: Why yes, yes I would!  
They settle on $10M.  

The Actor gets paid more than the actress, but it has nothing to do with sexism. How much you get paid in a competitive enterprise is 100% related to your ability to draw an audience, market yourself, and negotiate. You can say no. Hollywood actresses are some of the most powerful people on the planet, so lets not bullshit ourselves and suggest they are victims of some *powerful sexist cinema regime*.   

Like in the OP scenario:  
Hackman got paid X  
Newman got paid X  
Sarandon got paid Y  

Keep in mind there are OTHER movies competing for their services. If she had a better offer, and money was her priority, she would have taken it. Either she didn't have a better offer ($) or she didn't choose her role for $ alone. She was paid her market rate as negotiated by her agent, which is true of anyone in a free market contracting environment ever. And the agent gets paid more if she gets paid more - the agent has every incentive to try to the best deal as well.   

If you accept the contract, you accept the pay and the terms. She accepted less than they did. She didn't have to accept the role. She did because she thought the $ was worth her time. It's only when Sarandon found out what they were making that the $ was no longer satisfactory. Sounds like a whiny cunt to me.  

Your argument in response, every single time, is equivalent to you stomping your feet and trying to yell even louder. You aren't actually even making arguments - you're just adamantly insisting it must be sexism and entirely ignoring how business relations and contracting work.
 
If we're talking about Williams she WANTED the role. Wahlberg was convinced to do it ($$). There's a huge difference. Like Johnny Depp starred in Secret Window for less than market because he ""Always wanted to play a guy named Mort"". If you want something other than $, you trade $ for it. It's so obvious.  

But you'll just point to two instances where a woman was paid less than a man for *different* work, and completely ignore all the context around it just to continue to peddle your narrative. And you won't actually form any arguments. Like none of your arguments have any foundation at all, and they aren't explained at all. You can't look at outcomes and define the problem that way. You've done no root cause analysis. It's like walking around in the sun, seeing a puddle, and concluding that it must be raining.

I simply don't pretend there aren't differences between men and women, and I acknowledge that our places in society have formed naturally over thousands of years.

Of course global warming is not real. Neither is anything else the Democrats try to sell you on as reasons for larger and more powerful Government. Evolution is not a scientific theory as we can't test the theory in a controlled, repeatable, observable fashion that identifies variables. It doesn't stand up to any kind of scientific standard of establishing a theory such as relativity. That's beside the point at hand and a different discussion entirely. 

You are a post modernist and a scourge to society. You said women were punished for CHOOSING a non-competitive method. Just so we're clear, the women made a choice. The truth is, the subject of men making more on average than women is much more complicated and intricate than simply a difference in sex. Factors such as competitiveness, how agreeable one is, drive, motive, desire for respect from peers over social life/relationships, lifestyle choices ect. These women you are white knighting for are individuals that make individual choices. In a country like Sweden that is as socially engineered as possible, men and women still fall into certain careers more often than not, on their own volition. More women are nurses than men, and men are more engineers than women. The nature of men and women are different, men have more testosterone and are generally speaking more competitive than women. Competitiveness is certainly a predictor to success in highly competitive, high paying careers. The difference indicates a difference in the nature of men and women, physically, and mentally. In order to climb the ladder and make more money, you've got to be willing to sacrifice other areas of life especially in relationships, and family. Women tend to value those aspects of life more and don't want to sacrifice those things to climb the career ladder.

Its just the way it is. They are called the founding fathers, not the founding mothers. The wars that have been fought, Revolutionary, Civil and World War II were fought by men. It is how it is.

It wouldn't cripple anything.

Also, ""at the moment health care costs are inflated?"" Are you kidding me? They're massively exorbitant and people go into lifelong debt just to get mid level treatment.  To watch any interview with the Canadian citizen or doctor and show me that they wait years for treatment.

If you want to have a truly democratic government and not an anarchistic state then it is important for people to participate in it.

Their welfare state doesn't leave people drown in and a pool of death and illness and ineducation. Our current state does, there's a massive difference. Greed is the main component of capitalism,  Again, you might think that capitalism is the only thing that makes health care innovations possible but it is also what makes them unattainable for the people that actually need those services.  And guess what,  The amount that health care companies actually spend on research and development is nowhere near other countries because, guess what, why spend money on R and D when you can spend it on marketing and advertising.  Doctors are overpaid here and insurance companies continuously drain citizens of their ability to afford fairly priced treatment.

I had not seen Clerksn and I remember seeing the trailers for Mallrats and thought ""What a bunch of sophomoric crap, attempting to recapture the spirit of teen comedies of the 80s"" and paid it no attention. I was totally unaware that it belonged to any greater universe.  

Years later I finally saw Clerks and loved it. Then one night a few years after that, HBO is on in the background and Mallrats comes on. I'm not really paying attention to it for a while but then suddenly I hear Jay and Silent Bob. Wait... WHAT??!?!? It was then that I realized it was tied to the Clerks universe, so I watched it as soon as it was on again (pre-DVR days) and fell in love with it.

When BvS came out, he had an episode of SModcast where he talks about it. How he heard all the criticism and shit talking, but he went with Jay and they geeked out.

Clerks and Mallrats were awesome for their time, young filmmaker angry/depressed at his world and putting it on screen with enough dick and fart jokes to keep it light. Dogma was decent, higher budget, hit on religion pretty hard, still lots of dick and fart jokes to make it a comedy. Then... Jay and Silent Bob, no more real fire to the world, just dick and fart jokes.

Dude got married in '99, same year as Dogma came out. I reckon combined with that and financial success he found enough happiness to not lash out as much in film. Good for him, but it has definitely blunted what earned him his fans.",r3sonate

ektym2,Kevin Smith announces new Mallrats sequel Twilight of the Mallrats,fdehve9,2020-01-06 19:36:03,"I'm going to be brutally honest here, and this is coming from a Kevin Smith fan. I don't think he was ever that great of a director. He made some killer movies, that's for sure. Some of his films are among my favourites, but it really feels like he captured lightning in a bottle. His style is similar to Tarantino in that dialogue plays a huge role. Unlike Tarantino, however, he was never able to crack the rest of it. CLERKS worked because it was this indie film that didn't adhere to what everyone else was doing at the time. Acting is not a strong suit in CLERKS, and aside from the B+W thematic choice, the cinematography wasn't all that great either. Despite that, it really worked because it was so different. His follow up films used a similar template but they suffered the same shortcomings. Again, the timeframe in which they were released really helped propel them due to the cult following he had established. Films like Mallrats and Chasing Amy were riding the same success train that made CLERKS so good; Dialogue-heavy indie films that weren't too concerned with whatever Hollywood was doing at the time. I watch older Kevin Smith movies, mainly for Nostalgia, but I don't think they hold up that well aside from a specific few.

He does understand what's funny though, which is why his comedy resonates so well. I wouldn't say any of his comedies are well directed and even all that well-written and the acting is usually all over the place, but I'll watch Jay and Silent Bob because I like the characters and I know there will be a few laughs. I don't expect any new Kevin Smith film to really push the boundaries of the medium at all, and I usually go in expecting to be bored with bits of it. He continues to try and move the needle, but it rarely works. Tusk is a great example of how he's still trying to break new ground as that film sort of defies genres, but those same problems that his older films had also end up dragging it down. I feel like he has way bigger expectations for his films than he's able to deliver on, and I can't fault him for that, but my excitement for a new Kevin Smith film is always kept in check by those signature problems that have become somewhat charming in that they're a staple of his now.",Bitemarkz

IIRC, Tusk was based on a pot-fueled brainstorming session about an idea for a movie on his podcast that he somehow managed to turn into a feature film starring Johnny Depp. The podcast session where they came up with the idea played during the end credits.

I've not seen Red State, but I saw Yoga Hosers and it was almost painfully bad.

I think that sums up where Smith went wrong too. Movies like Jersey Girl, Zack and Miri and Cop Out certainly ***were*** concerned with Hollywood trends as they tried to emulate your typical romantic comedy, Judd Apatow comedy, and buddy cop film respectively.

Then you get this weird little one-off gem in Red State. A more serious and violent film than Smith had ever done with some heavy social commentary. I've heard people say that this was his best film since Clerks, and I'd tend to agree.

After that you get the darkest period of Smith's film making, Tusk and Yoga Hosers. I think the core thing that went wrong with these films was that, like Lucas before him, Smith became so powerful that he didn't have anyone around him to tell him no or curtail is less than stellar ideas. This was exacerbated by the fact that he self financed these flicks so he didn't have a studio to answer to either. Also to note, Smith started smoking weed heavily around this time, which can't be discounted when your dealing with the absurdity nazi sausage men. Moreover, you see elements of Smith getting too full of himself in Yoga Hosers being a shallow vehicle for his daughter's acting career, as well as in bringing on Johnny Depp for the brand appeal even though his character tonally clashed with both those films.",SickBurnBro

Red state he took to Sundance to auction off and then ultimately “bought” it himself and took it on the road. Ever since then he’s made movies for his audience and taken them directly to his audience. He’ll tour a movie and do a Q&A after the showing for a premium ticket price which makes them profitable. Red state actually had the highest per theater gross or something like that of all movies that year. He already charges $60+ for him to speak and he does that successfully all around the world.

His dick and fart jokes were hillarious to me as a teen, but they just seem forced now. (its like Blink-182 still singing about high school bullshit when they have mansions and are closer to 50 then 20)  I remember seeing this scene from PULP FICTION that QT edited out because he thought dialogue sounded too much like some hack trying to write like Tarantino (was scene where Mia filmed Vincent with an old camera)  When I say he has no idea what he is, i mean... When he started he was very upfront that actors read script as-is, no improv but as his star faded and the Appatow crew started hitting big with comedies filled with improv he completely pivoted.  He hired Seth, Craig and a bunch of other Apatow actors for Zack and Miri and I read an interview where Rogen was like ""I was so excited because I came to LA and my goal was to be in a Kevin Smith movie, but i was surprised that Smith said he wanted us to riff and improv as much as we wanted"" so yeah he just started to become a hack, chasing trends hoping they would make him look better.  And so much back and forth, saying ""STRIKE BACK"" was his big end to the View Askew universe (combining all the characters and even showing God (Alanis) close the View Askew book at the end of the movie...and then his original shit sucked.  Jersey Girl anyone? (TBH i loved Carlin in that) but yea the dude just keeps pumping out half baked, half-funded sequels to anything that might gain interest from his past.  Do you really think after all the favors he pulled from actors on his most recent film (that wasn't even widely released) that a mallrats sequel will get anyone big to come back?  Also: Tusk was good because Michael Parks acting in it (and RED STATE) was fucking amazing, but the moment they went full Walrus that movie shit the bed.  Look I can quote the early films and pretty much the entire clerks animated series verbatim, which is why this all pisses me off so much.

I still have faith in a potentially good Clerks 3. *Reboot*'s main problem was it didn't have an actual actor to carry it. As much as I like Jay and Silent Bob, they aren't there to carry movies by themselves. *Strike Back* succeeded because it had so many talented actors with roles that carried the movie along with more than just cameos. In *Reboot*, they were cameos and nothing more, most added almost nothing to the story (hell was there even a story?). Also, I really like Harley Quinn Smith, but she's not yet ready for the size of role her dad foisted upon her in this one. She's just not yet that great of an actress, but time could tell on that one. Quentin Tarantino saw enough in her to put her in a movie, but he and Kevin are friends so who knows?

The main reason I have faith in a Clerks 3 is because of Jeff Anderson, who was completely absent from *Reboot.* He's carried the entire Clerks series almost by himself, and with him and his wit back on the screen, I think Smith can make another decent movie.",Dvanpat
ektym2,Kevin Smith announces new Mallrats sequel Twilight of the Mallrats,fdeuavi,2020-01-06 21:39:11,"I think Kevin has been in a weird spot with his style of filmmaking and the kind of movie he likes to do.

Seth Rogen/James Franco/Evan Goldberg movies owe A LOT to Kevin Smith. They’re making the modern version of his type of movie and being more successful at it. These guys also aren’t shy about this. Kev is pretty close to Seth and Evan, and has worked with them a lot over the years.

But as a result, Kevin has to sort of push his own films a little further to the extreme and the results haven’t been great. You see this trend after he made Zach and Miri, which I don’t think he got enough credit for because it didn’t do well at the box office. It was a legit good film and was his best work ever behind the camera. Seth is also the perfect vehicle for his style of writing.

But anyways, he’s in a pickle because the modern Kevin Smith (Seth Rogen) has locked down the ViewAskew style movie, so Kev is retreading a lot of his older stuff or just running with bonkers ideas for the fun of it. I think he does his best work when he’s involved with something he’s passionate about but also has the freedom of using his sense of humor.

On a side note, I actually got to meet Kevin and Jay at SDCC last year. They were terrific guys and Kevin is as nice as everyone says. We chatted for a sec and he gave me a big hug. It’s hard not to root for a guy like him. He legitimately loves his fans and puts his heart into everything.",Dr_Disaster

They spend a decent chunk of time talking about star wars and we're now many decades removed from that (though it doesn't seem like it with the prequels and the new trilogy).  Hell half of it takes place in a type of business that doesn't really exist anymore and just thinking of that type of store immediately evokes the era of the movie (at least to me).",AberrantRambler
ektym2,Kevin Smith announces new Mallrats sequel Twilight of the Mallrats,fde9rfp,2020-01-06 18:11:40,"Yep I can definitely see that. Part of it is, like you said, the edgy bro humor of the 90s and 2000s that isn't as widely accepted anymore. I also think, to a certain extent, it has the same problem as American Beauty, which is that its such a ""first world problems"" type movie. (although out of the two, I rather sit through Clerk again any day of the week, because at least it's not creepy, and like you said, its much more relatable. American Beauty came across as such self indulgent trash). 

Its funny, I bought Waiting on DVD back in college and I only watched it once but I did think it did a good job capturing the disgruntled nature of retail. Ryan Reynolds is a real creep in that one too...",spacefink

Anyone who has ever worked a job has felt that way. This is where I think Office Space kind of does the same thing but way better. 

I actually think lots of the pop culture stuff is still pretty current. Star Wars is one of those franchises that just seems universally timeless. No matter what decade, everyone loves it.",spacefink

ektym2,Kevin Smith announces new Mallrats sequel Twilight of the Mallrats,fdf4sjk,2020-01-06 23:28:27,"Honestly man, I think you might be missing the point a bit, or you simply don’t relate to it. I wouldn’t say that it is a universal experience, even though it’s not uncommon. It’s really not about working a shitty job. The surface level humor and interactions, yeah sure. But it’s more about working a shitty job well past when society says it’s acceptable and starting to see life leave you behind. 

It’s definitely more for the slacker crowd who barely graduated high school, if at all, and found themselves at 22-23 still flipping burgers. If you were just some normal guy who got good grades, took your SATs and and toured colleges with your parents... yeah I mean your life probably doesn’t line up with it. 

Something like “Waiting” nails the same theme. On the surface it’s a comedy about working in a chain restaurant and the day to day interactions. But the main character starts realizing he’s going to get stuck there forever and just end up like all these other people. When the manager notices his potential and offers him a “real job” most of his friends turn on him for daring to do better. He gets shook to his core at the end when his old high school buddy comes in as a new professional engineer and takes pity on him. 

The whole theme is that this might be the best some of them can do and that’s okay. Some of them are perfectly happy with their current situation in life and that’s also okay. But he knows deep down that he isn’t happy, actually wants more for himself, and knows he can do better for himself if only he would actually try. Clerks is basically the same theme, but Dante never does make those changes in life, at least in this movie.

Office Space is more the opposite. It’s about a guy who did follow that “template” path to what society says is successful and still ends up miserable. He keeps pretending that his job’s annoyances are no big deal. He keeps dating some abusive girlfriend because he’s probably willfully naive. He keeps trying to fit the mold of what society says is what you should strive for. 

In the end he realized that his coworkers and everyone bitches about work, but they both ultimately still liked their jobs and place in life. He feels guilty about dragging them down in his misery. He ends up working in construction to the realization that he’s a happier person and the work suits him better. 

So yeah, they both have elements of “work sucks”, but Clerks and Waiting are definitely more powerful if you were in that exact spot at some point in your life.",vir_papyrus

I actually think it worked better because the truth is, every job and field with a hierarchy has a Lumbergh. As for you assuming I might identify because (you think) I got good grades? That's a reach and a half but I'll disregard it for now.

I can respect and understand that Clerks has achieved a dedicated fanbase and lots of people identify with it, but I still feel like it's more of a character study of how flawed or quirky these characters are than it is about the day to day of average clerks, and this is why I didn't really identify with it. I never really got the impression that the guys were ""slackers"" in high school (With the exception of Jay and Silent Bob, and those guys are very comfortable with who they are, lol). Even though Randall was edgy, he had the best mindset of all the guys. Like you said, he recognized he wasn't his job, in the same way Aniston's character recognized she wasn't just a waitress and that most people hate their jobs. Dante reminds me of so many guys who got angry because things didn't just ""happen"" for them. And it's not to even to say Dante shouldn't be disgruntled but at the same time, he took it out on people who genuinely cared about him, like his girlfriend or his friends. The problem was always Dante.

Also, I completely disagree with you about Peter's coworkers in Office Space. They liked doing software development, sure, but they hated who they worked for because Lumbergh was practically a sociopath. And even if they liked what they did, they were rewarded with getting fired even though they were better at their jobs than Peter was. Even Peter recognized how fucked up that was. So no, they didn't like their jobs either and they also felt stuck in their lives. Anything can become torture if the people you work for are abusive, regardless of whether you like what you do or not. Milton is a perfect example of what happens when you keep picking on people just because they seem like an easy target. Peter's coworkers do blame him but they also made their own choices and allowed Peter to drag them down. I do agree with you that Peter took things to a totally dark place on his own though (like his ""Superman"" plan to steal money from the company to get back at Lumbergh). and how Aniston rightly points out how obsessed he's become and he's still allowing the job to control him, or worse, make him no better than Lumbergh.

Hence, maybe you were/are some ordinary reasonably successful guy who couldn't relate to being like them.

>...more of a character study... than it is about the day to day of average clerks and this is why I didn't really identify with it

Yep exactly. Because it's not really about just being someone who worked at a gas station or convenience store or whatever. The sequel has them working at a McDonalds knockoff, and the same themes are still present. It's more about them stagnating in life and how each of them is dealing with it. 

>Dante reminds me of so many guys who got angry because things didn't just ""happen"" for them. And it's not to even to say Dante shouldn't be disgruntled but at the same time, he took it out on people who genuinely cared about him, like his girlfriend or his friends. The problem was always Dante.

Yeah again, exactly. I'm saying this film tends to resonate strongly with all those people you know who are, or once were, or have those tendencies to be like Dante. The entire message of the movie is, ""Don't be like Dante. If you want to change your life, shit or get off the pot"" That's the big climax at the end when Randell gets pissed off at him for being a whiny bitch.

>I actually think it worked better because the truth is, every job and field with a hierarchy has a Lumbergh... They liked doing software development, sure, but they hated who they worked for because Lumbergh was practically a sociopath... So no, they didn't like their jobs either and they also felt stuck in their lives

I think like you said a ""Lumbergh"" is in every job. In the movie he's really more of a stand-in face for the theme of soulless corporate politics and a terrible work/life balance than as a character. It's actually the joke in the movie about, ""I have 9 different bosses Bob"". Perhaps he's just the worst of the lot. 

I think the difference I was trying to express was that Micheal and Samir were relatively happy with their lives in general, even if they both were pissed off at the state of things/politics at work and hated their boss. Whereas Peter was unhappy with his life + job as a whole. 

Michael and Samir were the guys who still took pride in their work and still remained onboard. They were just like everyone else, they hated their boss and grumbled about it sure, but it wasn't really bad enough to bail. They were more pissed off at the indignation of being fired, despite their performance. But they were also the types of people who would probably seek greener pastures if things really did get that bad. 

Peter was a burn out who didn't give a shit about anything other than not getting fired, and probably secretly wanted to be. He's constantly bitching about the company and projecting that only pussies work there. He asks that hypothetical about what would you all do if you didn't care about money. He makes excuses for his shitty girlfriend and the way she treats him. He didn't have the courage to make the needed changes in his life or his job.

But in that movie, Anna Karina plays this woman named Nana, who leaves her husband and child to pursue a life in films. But it's obvious she doesn't have a real plan for what she wants to do and how she plans to execute it, and she almost wanders around aimlessly before she winds up becoming a prostitute. Throughout the whole film, an overarching theme is Nana's inability to communicate her needs and wants, and she sort of winds up being treated as a transactional good between two rival pimps. At one point, she comes across a philosopher in a cafe, who tells her this story about Porthos, who constantly was avoiding danger and then one day, blows up a bomb in a cellar and runs, and then suddenly begins to think. He comes so paralyzed with thought that he dies. I've always liked this interpretation someone said about the film, where basically ""Everyone is exploited in what they do. You might as well do what you love"" It made the most sense to me at the time and I think it kind of applies here (emphasis on kind of).

Aniston's character in Chotskie's is micromanaged by her awful boss in the same way that Lumbergh micromanages his employees. Even if she works in a restaurant and Michael and Samir work in an office, they're all dealing with the same bullshit.

>Yep exactly. Because it's not really about just being someone who worked at a gas station or convenience store or whatever. The sequel has them working at a McDonalds knockoff, and the same themes are still present. It's more about them stagnating in life and how each of them is dealing with it.

Fair enough, I have not seen the sequel so I wasn't aware this was a repeating theme with Clerks.

They were more pissed off at the indignation of being fired, despite their performance. But they were also the types of people who would probably seek greener pastures if things really did get that bad.

Again, even before Peter tells Michael about the layoffs, you can sense that Michael and Samir are disgruntled though. Michael complains about the office printer displaying PC Loader, he seems annoyed with the office ladies who constantly remark that someone has a case of the Mondays...he hates being reminded of Singer Michael Bolton. He's basically trying to do the same thing as Peter did prior to his hypnosis: avoid getting fired and just focus on what he likes about the job, which is only easier for him because he actually enjoys software development. If it wasn't bad enough to bail, it was because he needed the job to pay his rent. He's somewhat self convinced, just like everyone else, that people work the jobs they're meant to work because ""not everyone can be a millionaire"". He says this much to Peter when Peter brings up the question the guidance counselor asks him. Michael, like Peter was before his hypnosis, is complacent but he's not happy either.

In that sense, what he does isn't more remarkable than what Peter does, he just does what he has to do to get by.

You're right that both he and Samir take pride in their work, but overall, the whole office environment is toxic and everyone seems disengaged. But people have convinced themselves that there isn't anything better for them, which is why they continue to work at Initech. They're all afraid of change.

>Peter was a burn out who didn't give a shit about anything other than not getting fired, and probably secretly wanted to be.

>Milton is the end state of pre-hypnosis Peter. He's the ghost of Peter's office work future.

I think you're being a bit unfair on Peter and on Milton.

Post-Hypnosis Peter genuinely forces everyone to evaluate whether they're getting what they want out of where they're working. In that sense, you kind of have to admire him there. He does become selfish when he comes up with that scheme between himself, Michael and Samir with the Superman scam. But...he's not wrong in his hatred of Initech, he's just going about things in the absolute wrong way, and he's allowing Initech to prevent him from moving forward. His hatred of Initech consumes him to the point where he pushes everyone away.

Milton, on the other hand, is...not what I would consider a ghost of Peter's office future (perhaps if Peter had never gone under hypnosis, maybe, but even before hypnosis, Peter stood up for himself). Lumbergh can't passive aggressively micro-manage Peter anymore, because Peter begins to rebuff all his poor management, so he begins to take everything out on Milton, full assault. Milton is just the ultimate outcast and the perfect Office punching bag. In the metaphorical sense, he's like a chicken who's too different from the rest so they all peck him, and that's what Lumbergh does to him. The Bobs also take advantage of Milton as they know he's technically not an employee, but they decide it's best to just move him around and make him so uncomfortable he gets ""the hint"". They decide to stop paying him altogether but still let him come in (which is illegal) and then just begin to take full advantage of the situation. In a way, it's a scathing criticism of how Corporate capitalism sometimes operates unchecked and preys on very vulnerable people.

I think a better fit would be Tom: Tom is a senior employee who's having trouble adapting and the company knows it. I think had Peter not had his hypnosis, he most likely would have ended up like him. He would have been laid off when his skills were no longer useful for the company because he was too old, and maybe struck it rich from a freak accident. In a weird way, Tom got the ending Peter would have wanted: coast off on millions and have a nice retirement.

I hate to say it, but it has something to do with his ethnicity.  Doesn't take away from his films, but it's a reason he's overhyped?  

I mean I'm not saying it's a bad thing in the end, horror movies have a face, and it's a dude who obviously adores the genre, not sure what else we could ask for.  But his two horror movies so far are just good movies, and frankly I'm not sure what groundbreaking in terms of horror movies would be?  Would it just be movies that set the tone for the decade to come?  Like godzilla and monster movies were around when nuclear fears were present?  Slasher movies when serial killers were a real fear?  going overboard with gore like Saw?

Or is groundbreaking movies that are more meta like Scream and Cabin in the Woods?  ",Pocchari_Kevin

"" The only way to get rid of my *fears* is to make films about them.""  
\-Alfred Hitchcock  


"" The thing *under my bed* waiting to grab *my* ankle isn't real. I *know* that, and I also *know* that if I'm careful to keep *my* foot *under* the covers, it will never be able to grab *my* ankle.""  
\-Stephen King  


That last one from King isn't *exactly* on point, but I know he's talked many, many times in the past about how he was frightened by things as a kid, and still is to this day, but that writing about his fears can help him sort of conquer them. Basically, my point is that people who don't like horror, or who are too scared by it to like it, often assume (at least in my experience) that people who *do* like horror aren't scared by it, because they can't understand why we would want to feel scared. So if you hear that he was scared by horror as a kid, you assume that must mean that he didn't like it and avoided it, when in reality that's not what he said at all, and to someone who does like horror what he said makes perfect sense.",NotQuiteScheherazade

""How are the kids exactly the same if they were conceived by Human-Tethered rape? The clone sperm hit a natural human egg on one end, while up on the surface the same human sperm hit the same Tethered egg *twice*? The project was abandoned at least by the 80s and those teen girls are way younger than that yet they have exact clones. The same clone sperm hit the same clone egg at exactly the right time to create clone twins?

Why didn't *any other person ever* go to the funhouse and have their clone show up the same way Red/Adelaide met?

Did the government really think an escalator and an unguarded/unlocked door would keep them down in the tunnels?

How was the idea of revolution spread to other tunnels? Are there other tunnels?

You can't survive on rabbits. ""Rabbit starvation"" is very real. I can chalk this up to genetic engineering based how strong the clones seem to be.

Why didn't RealAdelaide just go up when she got free? She was obviously free around the same age since she was ballet dancing in the tunnels.

The Tethered gained free will but the boy, Pluto, randomly decides to mimic his real counterpart's movements to his own detriment?""",BaconPowder

It seemed like the tethers have at least some level of control over their actions and that as your mind becomes more ""awakened"" then you can fight it more and more. Hence how Adelaide was able to break free when the others could not and then inspired others to do the same. 

This would also make sense as to why Pluto was only able to be controlled some of the time -- because he was the youngest and least able to control himself.

You could also say that he didn't actually need to do what Jason was doing at that point but only did it because he was extremely animalistic and acted on instinct. And/or he was just a kid and not as intelligent as the older tethers.

This is one of the first horror films to address race in such a tasteful manner in a while, and I think it (along with other recent horrors such as It Follows) has paved the way for many more “smart horror” (though I hate the term as it demeans the genre) films to follow. I don’t think Us is nearly as culturally important, but Get Out was HUGE culturally and recognized both by critics and audiences as a masterclass of addressing race in film and working metaphors into horror.

Not a word, I think you mean diegetic, which still doesn't make sense in your phrasing.

>more about the themes, metaphors, and symbolism

That's fine, but the world is presented far too real and grounded as opposed to a more surreal depiction and tries to explain certain elements while leaving other elements blank to be filled in. Interpretive film making or story telling is fantastic, but in my opinion the movie suffered because there wasn't MORE left ambiguous, and since it tried to explain certain things logically, that's where people start talking plot holes.

 >not meant to be analyzed on a purely diagetic level.

I don't think that means what you think it means.   

>The answers to those questions don't make sense because they are not trying to make sense. They are not there to serve the diagetic plot but to serve the theme and metaphor.

They wouldn't make sense because in the world presented in the film, they couldn't make sense. 
  
>you also have to realize that's what the movie is trying to do. Whether it succeeded or not is up to you.

Oh we all realized what the film was ""trying to do"" and trying to say, [it was about as subtle as a sledge hammer.](https://youtu.be/f2oUaPFlbW8?list=PL34C1F26D03F5F9B8&t=723) 

Also, it IS entirely up to an audience and critical analysis ""Whether it succeeded"" or failed. If someone set out to paint the mona lisa, but it looked like a six year old's crayon drawing, what the person who drew it has to say about it doesn't make it so, objective observers would be able to say, ""Nope, you didn't quite get it"".

>For some reason, a lot of people are either unwilling or unable to look at pieces of media from a non-literal viewpoint. I'm not sure why, but this happens a lot.

Well, in the case of ""Us"", the problem is 85% of the film is presented at a very literal , or Diegetic, level and to it's own detriment. There is a whole whopping One metaphoric theme running through the film, and boy is it hammered home, but outside of that, people are presented as mostly normal (maybe even more realistic in some ways, ""what kinda white shit is that"", then they are in other films), it carries a very lax tone and strange tonal shifts into comedy (bringing it even further away from the surreal) and tries at times to over explain how what happens is possible, instead of just leaving it as a more mystical premise. 


You know, I doubt most people here on this sub are regular ol' general audience members, and have some affinity for all differnet types of films and film making, trying to say people aren't able to connect or analyze on a more than literal level, all while suggesting you're someone who ""gets it"" as opposed to others ""who don't get it"" just comes off as extremely snarky and pretentious. There are many many fair criticisms of this film, it doesn't mean it was an extremely weak film, or that it doesn't carry whatever cross people are actively rooting for it to carry, but it does mean it is far from a perfect film or a ""masterpiece"", and that's alright. Lord knows it's heads and shoulders above most of the mainstream horror or thriller dime a dozen films pumped out every year, but it surely isn't above reproach or fair criticism. ",None

I can’t comment on the other movies but mother! is just weird throughout and we aren’t meant to take anything as 100% true from the outset. Suspiria is similar and by the time the movie ends in a literal bloodbath between demons we’re like: “yeah this is insane, but it’s consistent with the world building that they’ve done so far.”

In Us for the first bit of the movie we’re taken into the life of a family. Everything focuses on their dynamic or individual fears/personalities. The movie descends into chaos not during the scene where the other family shows up, but rather during the explanation for how the family came to be. It’s at this point that the wheels come off and we realize that there’s an attempt at a greater meaning or large implications for this whole thing. That attempt at meaning and explanation ruins it for me because it’s trying to be consistent with the world building that Peele has done so far. That makes us try to question things in greater detail than we did in Get Out. There is no explanation for the Sunken Place in Get Out. It simply exists and these people use it. In contrast there is an explanation for the existence of the other family in Us, but it doesn’t explain enough. ",danny841

Haha. But here is basically my kind of loose, general interpretation, beginning with addressing your first question re: souls:  


&#x200B;

Yes, when Red gave her explanation of the clones at the end she gave the clones' lack of a soul as the explanation for why they are the way they are (animalistic, sub-human, puppets tethered to their copies above, etc.), but that's *her* interpretation. Remember: she was a young kid when she was trapped down there, she has a child's view of everything. A great example of this is when she says that while ""Adelaide"" (who we later find out was actually the clone, but I'll refer to her as Adelaide from here on out) gave birth to a ""beautiful girl,"" the clone (I'll call her Red from here on out) gave birth to a ""monster."" Just because she says that doesn't mean we have to take her word for it. We can interpret it the way we think it makes the most sense based on what we're shown in the movie. Since, at that point of the film and for most of the film until pretty much the very end, we only see these clones as exactly that, monsters, it's easy for us to accept what she says then at face value. When she says the girl is a monster, we believe it because it seems like she, and all the others, are exactly that. However, by the end of the movie we are shown enough of what the clones' lives have been like that we can begin to actually sympathize with them, and we realize that they really are just like us, but are victims of the lives/environment they are trapped in. They are monstrous--animalistic, sub-human, as I said--to us because they basically are animals--or, rather, they're exactly what we would be if we had been raised in the same circumstances (hence, one of the central themes of the movie). However, since Red was a little girl, with only very basic understandings of concepts like ""good"" and ""evil,"" of ""God,"" and of ""souls,"" without any of the nuance and ability to conceptualize that comes with growing up in normal society, she was forced to draw her own conclusions as to why the clones were they way they are: ergo, they must act like monsters because they are monsters; good people have souls, bad people (or monsters) don't, therefore, they must be soulless. To go back to my point about Red calling her clone-daughter a ""monster"" (since I went off on a tangent and kind of left it hanging), what I love about that line is that I realized after the movie was over that--since we realize by the end that the clones are really just *us*, and not really different or any more monstrous--the baby she gave birth to was just that, a baby. But to *her--*a little girl forced to live out this life with no control, no body autonomy, forced to stay in the mind of child without ever being able to mature past that stage mentally--to *her* the normal little baby seemed monstrous, just as it would if you forced any ""normal"" little girl up here to give birth to and take care of a baby. Since she was mentally still a child at the time, that's how it seemed to her. But, if you only take everything in the movie at face value--which is what a lot of people seem to be doing and why I'm constantly hearing the argument that ""he explained so much, but then stopped short of giving any real answers, so nothing makes sense""--then you'll be confused. You'll think, ""Wait, so if the point of the movie is that they're the same as us, then why does she say the little girl is a monster? And if they're soulless then they're not really like us, right? These explanations make no sense!"" But they're not meant to be taken as literal explanations for everything in the movie, they're just that character's interpretation/conceptualizing of her experiences, which you can fully understand and appreciate by the movie's end. We're not *ignoring* things that don't make sense, but just putting them in the context given in the movie and accepting that we're given unreliable narrators who don't completely understand their circumstances themselves. It's left up to us to interpret it how we think it makes sense.

They aren't, that's the entire point of the twist. If given the opportunity, they CAN have better lives.

>Why did she warn them they were coming? 

Who are you talking about? Adelaide? She DIDN'T know they were coming. She was just paranoid of that beach.

>Did she surpress the memory or know the whole time?

She knew the whole time. It's why she tells her husband to shut up when talking to them and why she's sympathetic to the tethered children (because she was in their situation too).

>Why didnt the real one say what happened years ago since she's the 'victim'? 

She can only say so much and at this point, all she cares about is getting revenge. They were planning on killing the entire family.

>Why didn't the real one just walk out like the other one did?

Because she was stuck down there because of their connection. ""I learned how to dance thanks to you.""

By that point she was down there surrounded by ""monsters"" for four years. She's obviously insane by this point. She felt more of a connection to the tethered and wanted them ""to be seen"" hence her plan and the line they form.

>How is the mimicking one directional but the clone ended up making the real one do what she does?

Because she was the only successful clone. The point of the experiment was that the tethered could control those above. But, that failed and the reverse happened.

>Why was the family so causal about killing, and so stupid when they split up?

Because they don't see these things as people, but monsters. Easy to disassociate. Also, they're people with two of them being children.

You're meant to just see them as a normal family reacting to this extraordinary situation, so the things they do and say should seem to comply with that. I think you've mentioned that one of your problems with the film (and one that I see mentioned a lot) is that the family *doesn't* do this, but instead are too nonchalant and jokey when they should be deadly serious and/or in shock. And I think that's fair, to a point. Like I said, those parts are the ""grounded"" part of the film, so they shouldn't cause us to question anything too much. If that happened for you, and a lot of other people, then I guess it's a valid complaint, even if I personally thought it wasn't a big deal and could be easily overlooked. To each his own.  


However, when it comes to the more surreal aspects of the film--so, pretty much everything involving the clones--it's not that you're being too ""logical"" when you should just accept it's a giant metaphor and leave it at that. No, you're right that it should still make at least some sense--but what we're saying is that it *does* makes sense, but ""makes sense"" isn't the same as ""explains everything."" I think what a lot of people are doing is taking everything that's offered as an ""explanation"" in the film (almost all of them given by Red) at face value and as complete gospel. But Red is an unreliable narrator. She doesn't really understand what's happened to her, why it happened, or how, so when we hear her interpretation of the answers to those questions, we need to keep that in mind. I think this is where the big issue is between those of us who thought the movie made as much sense as it needed to and didn't really need to explain anything further, and those of you who are having a harder time of it.

Oh, because of the mighty PLOT ARMOR.

On the subject of the ""monster"" comment. I cant see how its symbolic of how she sees the clones BUT she specifically called her daughter a monster. No one else. We believe that girl is a monster because SHE HUNTS LITTLE GIRLS AND KILLS PEOPLE THAT GET IN HER WAY. **No need for extrapolation or reading between the lines.** By the end of the movie, we see another family get brutally murdered in their home, the monster little girl jump on a moving vehicle and stab it a few times, the streets filled with dead bodies, and a little boy trying to blow up a car with a family of 4 inside.

the other one wasnt ""stuck"". free will just goes out the window to a limited extent until its convenient years later? She woke up handcuffed to the bed, then within weeks she was dancing.

Its easy to disassociate children? Its easy to disassociate SOMEONE THAT HAS YOUR FACE? Thats insane.

The whole movie falls apart completely if you think about it for more than a second, which I did on the 20-minute drive home and came up with these:

How are the kids exactly the same if they were conceived by Human-Tethered rape? The clone sperm hit a natural human egg on one end, while up on the surface the same human sperm hit the same Tethered egg *twice*? The project was abandoned at least by the 80s and those teen girls are way younger than that yet they have exact clones. The same clone sperm hit the same clone egg at exactly the right time to create clone twins?

Why didn't *any other person ever* go to the funhouse and have their clone show up the same way Red/Adelaide met?

Did the government really think an escalator and an unguarded/unlocked door would keep them down in the tunnels?

How was the idea of revolution spread to other tunnels? Are there other tunnels?

You can't survive on rabbits. ""Rabbit starvation"" is very real. I can chalk this up to genetic engineering based how strong the clones seem to be.

I agree. That's why my argument isn't ""it's not supposed to be realistic,"" but just that my suspension of disbelief goes further than yours and I don't find it unreasonable to suspend my disbelief as far as the movie is asking me to. That's all.  


> I can chalk this up to genetic engineering based how strong the clones seem to be. 

This is what I'm talking about. You can suspend your disbelief and accept the explanation/inference that there was obviously genetic engineering at play here that might be able to explain some things, but you're only willing to apply it to this specific scenario? Why not also apply it to how the children ended up as exact clones as well? That's how I look at it. I think the movie makes it very obvious that there was more done to them than just cloning, since they also are forced to mimic our movements. That fact alone tells us that more was done to them and that they aren't just perfect copies of us; there's more to it than that. So, with that in mind, I'm perfectly comfortable accepting certain things about them that, while they wouldn't make sense in a ""real world"" scenario involving clones, and even though the movie doesn't perfectly spell it out for us, make sense in the context that the movie gives us: they are science experiments; who knows exactly *what* was done to them and what effects it had. You may see this as cop-out, but honestly I don't see how. The movie provided us with information (i.e. that the clones were a government-run science experiment designed to control citizens), and while it didn't spell out answers to specific questions (e.g. how are the kids perfect clones too, how can they survive only on rabbits, how does the Tether even really work and why, etc.), the information it *did* provide can aptly cover all of that. It would be a cop-out if one of those things still didn't make sense even with the science experiment explanation or if the movie directly contradicted itself in some way and we just waved it away with ""it's just fantasy"" or ""they were experimented on, get over it"" but I honestly don't see any issues like that in the film.

She had been down there for a few years by the time the ballet scene happened (I think they say she was 9 when the switch happened, and then about 13 or 14--since it's mentioned she peaked at 14 and quit soon after that--when she gave the recital), so I don't think it's much of a stretch to say she's probably insane by that point. Also, she's a child; children adapt to their surroundings. All she's known for the past few years is that she's trapped in this hell, forced, like everyone around her, to act like a puppet on strings, without knowing how or why. Again, I don't think it's a stretch to assume that, even if she's not ""insane"" by this point, she's at least more focused on hatred, bitterness, resentment, and thoughts of revenge than of escape.  
I'm not sure what you're referring to about Pluto. Do you mean when he walks backward into the flames at the end? Because that's not what I thought was happening. If anything, I thought that Pluto was trying to manipulate Jason to back up so that Red could grab him. I literally thought, ""oh no they're tricking him into backing up"" before it was even revealed that Red was standing next to him because it seemed obvious to me. But maybe I'm wrong there and Jason was controlling him. Which, you know, I still don't think is all that hard to accept considering they pretty clearly show that Pluto is a lot more unstable than the others--he's basically treated like a pet rather than like ""part of the family,"" so, again, I don't think it's much of a stretch to assume that maybe, since he's unstable, his free will is unstable as well and he's more susceptible to the Tether.

The pyro lead quit before the helicopter crash due to unsafe and reckless working conditions, and it was some junior lacky who set off the pyro that took down the helicopter.

There are two reasons Landis escaped justice: 1 the district attorney went for the jugular, and moronically decided to not include any lesser included charges that could have been covered by negligence, and 2 a specialist on the helicopter used testified that he had never seen this sort of malfunction, even in vietnam, and the pyro should not have been enough to take down a well maintained helicopter. This backed the jury into a corner where they could not convict on the charges and instructions given to them.

IMO Landis should have gone to jail. This didnt even end Landis' career. What killed his career was his movies not raking in the money anymore.

It didn't. The conventional wisdom, repeated in numerous sources without any real support, is definitely that “Landis's career was not significantly affected by the incident.” See, e.g., Twilight Zone accident - Wikipedia. From a distance, such a claim seems plausible: after all, Twilight Zone was filmed in 1982 and Landis directed a number of hit movies later in the 1980s. However, a detailed look at the actual history shows that although the Twilight Zone accident did not put an immediate end to Landis’s career as a director, it dealt his career a serious wound that ultimately proved fatal.

First, if you look at at Landis’s credits, a lot of his most famous work occurred prior to The Twilight Zone, and the majority of the successes Landis had after Twilight Zone was shot in 1982 were prior to his being tried for manslaughter in 1986. Trading Places, for example, had been set for some time and began filming immediately after Twilight Zone wrapped, so the accident was not going to impact that film. Landis further completed Three Amigos and Spies Like Us before his damaging nine-month manslaughter trial.


think Landis could have come away from the Twilight Zone accident with his career largely intact had the accident merely resulted in confidential settlements of wrongful death lawsuits and a slap on the wrist for violating child labor laws. After all, Hollywood tolerates a lot of questionable conduct—and generally keeps it quiet—if the end result is box office success, and pre-1982, what few protections there were for people working on movie and television productions were often ignored. But that didn’t happen. Instead, Landis became the first director charged with a felony for a death on set, and during the lengthy and highly-charged trial (the prosecutor called Landis a murderer and asserted that he should have been charged with murder, not involuntary manslaughter), the many bad decisions leading up to the horrific deaths of three actors (two of them children) were discussed in detail. Although Landis and his co-defendants were acquitted in 1987, Landis was depicted as arrogant, uncaring, and out of control, and his testimony regarding the accident was contradicted by numerous witnesses. The accident also created a great deal of strife between studios and various worker unions, with Hollywood responding by making myriad changes in policies and procedures in order to lower risk of future injuries/deaths on set.

Moviemaking is a business, and while Landis was largely gold at the box office, he caused problems for the entire film industry and now came with a lot of risk attached; it was understandable that after the trial, studios wanted to keep their distance, and they largely did. After 1987, Landis worked on only two more major films, Coming to America in 1988 (an enormous hit) and Beverly Hills Cop 3 in 1994 (a largely forgotten film that suffered from script/budget problems, was panned by critics, and was a disappointment at the box office). Both of these films had one thing in common: Eddie Murphy. Murphy at that point was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood; he decided to hire his former Trading Places director, and given his status, he was going to get what he wanted. Absent Murphy, I suspect that Landis would not have been hired.

Setting aside the two Murphy films, by the early 1990s, what you see from Landis is comedy, horror, and documentary work on a largely decreasing budget. He had a few flops and after that, no real work in film other than production and small parts in other people's movies. Obviously, most people in Hollywood would love to have 1/100th of the success John Landis did, and I’m sure that Landis has made a great living by any objective standard with even his work since the mid-1990s. But at the time Twilight Zone was made, Landis was just 31 years old and already one of the most in demand directors working in Hollywood. There’s no reason that he couldn’t be making major studio films today—many of his peers still are—but he obviously isn’t. Similarly, one would ordinarily expect that a director who was attached to some of the most beloved and financially successful films of the 1970s and 80s would be able to take his pick of studio projects for some time and that a few box office disappointments wouldn’t mean a transition to television and b-movie work. Again, however, that’s not how things worked out. If you look at Landis’s career from the time of his 1986–87 trial as opposed to the 1982 accident, it is clear that Twilight Zone did in fact largely destroy his career as a director.",Rustofcarcosa

It didn't. The conventional wisdom, repeated in numerous sources without any real support, is definitely that “Landis's career was not significantly affected by the incident.” See, e.g., Twilight Zone accident - Wikipedia. From a distance, such a claim seems plausible: after all, Twilight Zone was filmed in 1982 and Landis directed a number of hit movies later in the 1980s. However, a detailed look at the actual history shows that although the Twilight Zone accident did not put an immediate end to Landis’s career as a director, it dealt his career a serious wound that ultimately proved fatal.

First, if you look at at Landis’s credits, a lot of his most famous work occurred prior to The Twilight Zone, and the majority of the successes Landis had after Twilight Zone was shot in 1982 were prior to his being tried for manslaughter in 1986. Trading Places, for example, had been set for some time and began filming immediately after Twilight Zone wrapped, so the accident was not going to impact that film. Landis further completed Three Amigos and Spies Like Us before his damaging nine-month manslaughter trial.


think Landis could have come away from the Twilight Zone accident with his career largely intact had the accident merely resulted in confidential settlements of wrongful death lawsuits and a slap on the wrist for violating child labor laws. After all, Hollywood tolerates a lot of questionable conduct—and generally keeps it quiet—if the end result is box office success, and pre-1982, what few protections there were for people working on movie and television productions were often ignored. But that didn’t happen. Instead, Landis became the first director charged with a felony for a death on set, and during the lengthy and highly-charged trial (the prosecutor called Landis a murderer and asserted that he should have been charged with murder, not involuntary manslaughter), the many bad decisions leading up to the horrific deaths of three actors (two of them children) were discussed in detail. Although Landis and his co-defendants were acquitted in 1987, Landis was depicted as arrogant, uncaring, and out of control, and his testimony regarding the accident was contradicted by numerous witnesses. The accident also created a great deal of strife between studios and various worker unions, with Hollywood responding by making myriad changes in policies and procedures in order to lower risk of future injuries/deaths on set.

Moviemaking is a business, and while Landis was largely gold at the box office, he caused problems for the entire film industry and now came with a lot of risk attached; it was understandable that after the trial, studios wanted to keep their distance, and they largely did. After 1987, Landis worked on only two more major films, Coming to America in 1988 (an enormous hit) and Beverly Hills Cop 3 in 1994 (a largely forgotten film that suffered from script/budget problems, was panned by critics, and was a disappointment at the box office). Both of these films had one thing in common: Eddie Murphy. Murphy at that point was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood; he decided to hire his former Trading Places director, and given his status, he was going to get what he wanted. Absent Murphy, I suspect that Landis would not have been hired.

Setting aside the two Murphy films, by the early 1990s, what you see from Landis is comedy, horror, and documentary work on a largely decreasing budget. He had a few flops and after that, no real work in film other than production and small parts in other people's movies. Obviously, most people in Hollywood would love to have 1/100th of the success John Landis did, and I’m sure that Landis has made a great living by any objective standard with even his work since the mid-1990s. But at the time Twilight Zone was made, Landis was just 31 years old and already one of the most in demand directors working in Hollywood. There’s no reason that he couldn’t be making major studio films today—many of his peers still are—but he obviously isn’t. Similarly, one would ordinarily expect that a director who was attached to some of the most beloved and financially successful films of the 1970s and 80s would be able to take his pick of studio projects for some time and that a few box office disappointments wouldn’t mean a transition to television and b-movie work. Again, however, that’s not how things worked out. If you look at Landis’s career from the time of his 1986–87 trial as opposed to the 1982 accident, it is clear that Twilight Zone did in fact largely destroy his career as a director.",Rustofcarcosa

Four months had gone by since the district attorney’s office first got Interpol to search for Marshall after he skipped England and thumbed his nose at the brisk lady from the embassy who with L.A. Deputy Sheriff Tom Budds was waiting to serve him the subpoena. The idea of going after Marshall was no longer practical. So, when, **in a panic Marshall’s lawyer Rick Rosen called Lea D’Agostino, he was able to persuade the prosecutor to lift the hold on Kathleen Kennedy and inform Interpol** that she was no longer needed as a witness in the *Twilight Zone* manslaughter case.”

Personally I don't subscribe to this, but I think a good director can pull out great performances out of almost anyone, and that bad directors can make even capable actors seem terrible.

There are standards ackowledged with the consensus of filmmakers, critics and academics.
Many movies are made cheaply ignoring those standards with the pourpose of making money over people who are not well versed in the cinematic language.

Corporate-made movies are made to appeal to people whose tastes have been shaped by the constant exposition to only corporate-made entertainement, and while we might infer that this vicious feedback loop isn't bad, that language evolves according to the majority etc... i believe that this mindless drifting towards the lowest common denominator isn't good for anyone except for a bunch of hollywood producers and corporations who hold the rights for super-famous charachters and similar brands.

I think the way it ended made any attempted character development moot. He never really developed past his obsession to discover something that the audience never really sees. He left his family, for nothing; he was ridiculed by his colleagues, for nothing; he buried friends, for nothing.

As someone who used to follow Kelly with enthusiasm, and actually saw what he was going for with Southland Tales (okay, I saw a LITTLE of what he was going for but enjoyed it nonetheless) actually liked the direction of The Box and talked with him about on Twitter one day, I thought he had dropped out. Then one day here on Reddit someone dropped this story with a link to an anonymous post on a site i guess Hollywood people go to get shit off their chest, that he actually stole the script for Darko from his roommate that passed away and a half finished script for Southland Tales. Could be bullshit(probably bullshit) but with his career trajectory it sometimes seems to me that even though Southland bombed (and bombed about as hard as you can bomb with that budget) that Kelly still should’ve bounced back after that. He’s a very competent director no matter what. With The Box being a Twilight Zone episode anyway, this is kinda odd, since people didn’t like that interpretation, what will they think of this one?

There are so many things that can go wrong during a film's production that could explain some of his later misfires.  But to so clumsily mangle a fairly brilliant existing film seems to show that he didn't understand what it was that made *Donnie Darko* so great in the first place.

Maybe the original cut was the result of producer/studio oversight, or maybe it was just a fluke.  Either way, all his subsequent work suggests he really doesn't belong in a director's chair.

First, I haven’t seen The Box since I was a teen, and at the time I liked it, but I also had lower standards.

As for Southland Tales, I watched that like two years ago and I thought it was poorly made. I was intrigued, and I didn’t hate it, but there so many weird decisions.

First, the visual effects were terrible and don’t hold up. Second, a lot of the casting was weird and made no sense to me. I think Richard Kelly was trying to intentionally cast people you wouldn’t expect, but Jon Lovitz in particular gave such an awkward performance.

As for the story, it was convoluted and made no sense. In a way, I don’t care if a movie is confusing so long as it’s engaging and leaves me wondering. I love Mulholland Drive and Under the Silver Lake. But I found myself bored with Southland Tales.

To the top comment. I enjoyed Lego’s joker visually. The speaking parts not so much. I also don’t like Ledger as much as everyone else does. He’s good. He’s not what I’d imagine up though. I wanna see Mark Hamill’s joker in a live action with Harley. 

It doesn’t have to be him. (Hamill) I just wanna see the lunatic that always giggles or laughs while trying to do the most insane robberies or heists. Batman the animated series has the best depiction of a Joker character IMO. 

The movie even took inspiration from that series.


E: I never watched his movie. I’m watching it now and it’s pretty good. It feels like a Batman Year One deal mixed with an Action Comics type deal. He isn’t really Justice League level yet. He doesn’t have a real Batmobile, suit or gadgets.  I can watch more of him as Batman. I’ll take my downvotes.",mark503

The specific changes made to the end of Dune 2 kind of make it very clear the direction they are going in for Dune 3. 

It's going to be half adaptation of Dune Messiah, half traditional sequel to Dune 2. 

It's a huge change to the books to have the other Great Noble Houses reject Paul's ascension to the throne (and doesn't really make sense at all given their utter dependency on spice) and have *that* be the cause of the great war/jihad, but there's a big narrative reason for this change. 

I think Dune 3 will open 16-20 years later and it will be the final days of the war, the mopping up, the last defensive holdouts being assaulted (as opposed to the war being long over in the book). This way they can still include huge spectacle action set pieces on worlds other than Arrakis, but the war is not the main focus of the plot, that's still the conspiracy against Paul and stuff going on in Paul's mind bogglingly huge Imperial Palace on Arrakis. 


It's for sure going to be half Messiah/half traditional sequel to Dune 2.




If I were written Dune 3, I'd open it with a Fremen assault on one of the last hold out worlds and use the opportunity to show 1) why the Fremen are so feared and successful as warriors across the Empire and 2) introduce the Guild Navigators and the logistics of their ships and moving armies around. I'd have the first meeting of the conspirators (the 1st scene in the book) happen on a Guild ship transporting Paul's forces to the planet. That way it makes sense for the Navigator to be physically present and makes sense that Irulan is there personally overseeing an important Atreides operation. Stilgar is probably leading the operation. 

I think I'd take a big narrative gamble and hold off showing Paul on screen for as long as possible so for a long time the audience only *hears* about him from other characters talking about how insanely powerful he's become and how terrifying it is for others to have an Emperor who is prescient and has an insane loyal force of fundamentalist warriors and control of the most important resource in the galaxy. Let all that sink in before finally reintroducing Paul the actual person. Possibly as long as like 20-25 minutes before Paul is seen in the flesh... probably in a throne room scene from the perspective of someone else where he is terrifying.",lessthanabelian

Dune 3 is mainly about Paul setting out to find Chani, who is pregnant, while some other factions do the same. The babies are shielding her from Paul's prescience. The Corrinos and Bene Gesserit want to kill her and the children, but importantly Irulan hasn't approved this. Hayt is introduced when he comes to Paul claiming to know where she is, he seems to be trying to help Paul, but he's programmed to kill Chani as soon as they find her.    

Paul finds Chani but not before she is wounded badly, not by Hayt of course, so she dies during childbirth. Then Paul sets out into the desert.",Brad_Brace

Even from a movie storytelling perspective, having a “default” state helps the audience keep track of who the character is.

Unlike previous models, where the logic traps or X ray gave them away- the T-X line *was* mostly human. The nanotechnology took a corpse of relatively low damage and rebuilt it using the bones and flesh of the body. It integrated into the cellular structure of a human body and essentially *reanimated* a dead human being.

The clones in Star Wars are a weird case for this. We know that biologically, they should be in their late teens/20s for most of the prequels, and while they did have an appropriately aged actor for the scenes on Kamino, they still used Temeura Morrison's voice in Attack of the Clones. He played the clones in Revenge of the Sith. And then you have the whole controversy over how the clones look in the cartoons. 

My personal theory has always been that Lucas felt uncomfortable showing just how young the clones actually were, especially when he seemed intent on showing them as almost machine-like monsters. The human portrayals we all know and love don't come until later. 

If you look at old sketches and depictions of Duncan, he doesn't actually sound white and in fact, I have always suspected that Lucas made the decision to cast Morrison as Jango because he thought he somewhat fit his idea of Duncan Idaho.

They were massive hits, set viewership records.  Had plans for two full TV series to follow.  One I think was gonna follow Duncan, I don't know if anything ever leaked about the the second.  Then a regime change at the channel killed the franchise.

The first one was spotty.  Didn't have a real director. Some bad/silly choices. Still worth the watch. 

The sequel was directed by Greg Yaitanes, so was much better all around.  They did Messiah as the first episode, Children as the following two.  The tone of Messiah was pitch perfect.  Still had budgetary restrictions that hurt it, but nailed the tone.",Mildly_Irritated_Max

He was working as his children's agent and manager but was such a dickhead - like overworking Macauley who was putting out two-to-four different projects a year, to forcing the studio into casting Macauley in The Good Son if they wanted him for Home Alone 2 (which caused a huge delay as the studio had to dismiss the original star) - that studios and casting directors were refusing to cast for roles solely to stop dealing with Kit Culkin.

Chris Columbus, who was directing the first film, hates stage parents so much that he implimented rules that stated that patents had to be interviewed separately from their children for psychological evaluation - if the production staff got even a whiff that the kids were being made to audition against their will or their parents pushed them into it, they were disqualified from the casting call regardless of how well they did.

Also is why whole character animation sequences were reused between movies. The first copy-paste for animation.

'Puff the Magic Dragon' was a song that came out in 1963 by 'Peter, Paul and Mary'. It was written by Peter Yarrow, but the lyrics were based on a poem that Peter's college roommate, Leonard Lipton, wrote, and Peter had used the words in his song sometime later. Lipton wrote the poem about a dragon in 1959, when he was 19, and, when Yarrow found it, he wrote the lyrics to ""Puff"" based on the poem. After the song was released, Yarrow searched for Lipton to give him credit for the song.
Leonard Lipton didn't really know what to do with the royalties but he was into filmmaking and was now financially independent because the song was a big hit.

Royalties from ""Puff the Magic Dragon"" and Independent Filmmaking, a book he wrote, which remained in print for 20 years, gave Lipton an independent income that allowed him to follow his interests. His career in stereoscopic display began to gel around 1972. In one early stint, he served as the ""convergence setter"" for the 1983 3D film Rottweiler: Dogs from Hell, determining for each shot the optimal position at which to cross the dual lens axes. Previewing a scene from the film, technical staff from Universal were impressed by the stereoscopic imagery.

He built a prototype of a flicker-free, field-sequential 3D display system and founded StereoGraphics Corporation in 1980 to fund development. The system worked by doubling the display rate of images, thereby overcoming a problem inherent in 3D motion picture projection, where each eye views only half the available images.

In 1989, he patented the active ZScreen polarization filter that uses a circularly polarized liquid crystal filter placed in front of a projector, which can then display both the left and right halves of a stereo pair. After Real D Cinema acquired StereoGraphics in 2005, the technology became the basis for the RealD cinema system.

The system was in use in more than 30,000 screens worldwide and was the modern standard for 3D movies. Lipton was the chief technology officer at RealD until 2009, when he left to do independent consulting. He died in 2022.

In the 70s an area business man, reading these stories of sightings in the newspaper decided to make an ultra low budget movie called “The Legend of Boggy Creek” about the cryptid. 

Mixing interviews with the real people who claimed to have seen the creature and re-enactments it was one of the first docu-dramas and lent the horror movie a sense of authenticity. It went on to do ridiculously well on the drive-in circuit, making reportedly 25 million against its $160,000 budget. It was later cited as a major influence by the people who made *The Blair Witch Project*

Ralph McQuarrie was working as a technical illustrator for Boeing when he was hired to create the [movie poster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/The_Legend_of_Boggy_Creek_promotional_poster.jpg) for the film.

After the First World War, Germany in the silent film era (of the Weimar Republic) was emerging as a real rival to Hollywood, in terms of producing brilliant, ground-breaking, popular films. 

One of the most innovative of the German studios was UFA. (Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft, or Universal Film Inc.).  UFA was a leader in making expressionist films, like **The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari** or the **Dr. Mabusa** detective films. 

Fritz Lang wanted to make a wildly original film, one way ahead of its time, about the futuristic city Metropolis, which pushed the envelope for special effects.   For those of you haven't seen it:  the film is a bit mind-blowing:  futuristic cities; sexy-dancing robots; class conflict; and heavy-handed social commentary.  

It also was so expensive (5 million Reichsmarks) that it basically bankrupted the studio.

This bankruptcy allowed an ultra-right-wing nationalist politician and industrialist, Alfred Hugenberg (basically the Rupert Murdoch of 1920s Germany) to basically swoop in and buy up control of the studio.  

For a few more years, UFA continued in its old way, making films like **Asphalt** (gritty urban drama) and especially with their hit **The Blue Angel** (which made Marlene Dietrich world-famous).    

But Hugenberg was also one of the key right-wing figures who was levering Adolf Hitler into power...   and so Hugenberg increasingly steered UFA towards hyper-nationalistic films.  Once Hitler came to power (in 1933), UFA  basically ended up making propaganda films for the National Socialists (Nazis) and Joseph Goebbels' propaganda ministry. 

The German film industry never recovered its potential, and Hollywood became the world's undisputed center of filmmaking.   

How much was this due to **Metropolis**?  We'll never know.     

(Metropolis, I might argue, also prefigures the propaganda of Hitler, with the ""future"" society's intractable social-class divides being resolved by the intervention of single Great Leader...)",DerProfessor

It opened the floodgates for indie filmmakers to get their stuff out there.

The direction that Disney chose to go in to heavily lean the marketing into the fact they had a very well known star like Robin Williams voicing a main character (while not the first to do this, I’d say Oliver and Company doing this with Billy Joel was kinda the first big instance, but certainly Aladdin was the turning point for the industry) fundamentally changed how studios cast and market animated movies. 

Because of that decision now basically every major animated movie has a very big chunk of its marketing based around how many celebrities star in it, which also means way more non-voice actor celebrities are casted in these productions. It’s also why it’s so common for a “guest staring *insert famous musician*” is basically a standard in big budget animated movies now (again, Bill Joel in Oliver and Company is most influential on this front). 

Ironically Robin Williams tried to prevent this from happening. He had it in his contract that he could only be used in a certain percent of the marketing. Disney immediately starting finding creative workarounds for that, and eventually just ignored it all together. Which resulted in Williams resenting Disney for years after that. 

I think the funniest manifestation of this trend is Studio Ghibili movie English dubs. A lot of people don’t realize Ghibili movies have starred Christian Bale, Mark Hamill, Shia Labeouff, Uma Thurman, Andy Dick, Michael Keaton, JK Simmons, Billy Bob Thornton, Jada Pinket Smith, Anne Hathaway, Tim Curry, Josh Hutcherson, Willem Dafoe, Matt Damon, Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, Betty White, Will Arnet, Jamie Lee Curtis, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Elijah Wood, Stanley Tucci, John Kraskinski, John C Reilly, Robert Pattinson, Cate Blanchett and I’m not shitting you Jeff fucking Dunham.

Besides a completely insane conformed cast including Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, and Mick Jagger, whose association didn't really lead to anything, Jodorowsky's pre-production search exposed HR Giger to the film industry.

The pre-production visual design of the film was the brainchild of H. R. Giger, Chris Foss (the legendary sci-fi book cover artist), and Jean Giraud (the legendary illustrator ""Mobius"") for set and character design, along with then-unknown Dan O'Bannon for special effects design. This crew went on shortly after *Dune* production stalled in 1976 to worth together on the seminal *Alien* (1979), which O'Bannon co-wrote.

As fans of the science fiction and horror genres know, Giger, Foss, Guraud, and O'Bannon were a hugely influential creative force in the industry. *Alien* had a tremendous impact on film, and the team's distinctive visual design and character work directly shaped two decades of genre filmmaking.

All thanks to one insane Chilean-French filmmaker who had the creativity and chutzpah to try to adapt Dune into a single 14-hour film. There was a great documentary about this, called *Jodorowsky's Dune*. Worth watching to see the early concept art from Giger and team.",dakta

They made notable classic cartoons such as Mr. Magoo & Gerald McBoing Boing. 

Magoo & Gerald, on top of most of UPA’s theatrical shorts were distributed by Columbia pictures through 1959. Their last few Columbia shorts weren’t well received critically, on top of of Columbia’s former TV division, screen gems, starting a deal with the then-new Hanna-Barbera Productions, so for the most part, UPA would self distribute. UPA also used to import Godzilla films to the US in the late 60s/70s, around the time they got out of animation.

Chuck Jones, a famed director of many of the greatest looney tunes shorts (including “what’s opera, doc?”) was directing Gay Purr-ee for UPA. But then when Warner Bros picked up the UPA film for distribution, they fired Chuck Jones. Among his last work for Warner bros was the underrated short “Now Hear This”, which was also the first short to use the creepy “abstract wb” logo … and not to mention that logo was originally meant to be used for JUST Now Hear This. 

But nope, they start using it more after he left Warner bros, and after that time, they begin outsourcing animation to Depatie-Freleng Enterprises (the same animation studio behind the Pink Panther cartoons, and many Dr. Seuss tv specials from the 70s, like The Lorax, Dr. Seuss on the Loose & Grinch Night) and Format films briefly from 1964-67. This era, and the “7 arts” era that followed it are widely considered by many Looney Tunes fans to be some of the worst looney tunes cartoons, like the ones where Daffy chases speedy Gonzales, where they make daffy a big asshole. 

In fact, the abstract wb logo in itself often meant “change the channel” or “skip/fast forward the episode!” (If it was vhs or dvd), not to mention finding the logo lowkey unsettling as a kid. Except if the abstract wb logo had a white bg and not the usual black, with the ending logo being the Big Ben chimes for sound effects instead of the usual closing variant of the sensory overload-ass rendition of “the merry go round broke down” … you were in for a trippy treat. 

My dad, who’s a gen X’er and a looney tunes fan, once said that “once they fired chuck jones, it permanently cursed their animation studio” and he couldn’t be anymore right. Since 1964, in terms of animation, Warner has always been hit or miss, especially in terms of Looney Tunes related stuff.",Popculturefan99

They used moco to match a tracking shot from an previously shot scene and used face replacement techniques that had never been used in such large capacity without the original actor.

On a related note, I can't be convinced they didn't outright torture those rats in The Abyss. The scene is edited super weirdly with only a few awkward seconds of footage. That's because the rats were literally shitting themselves out of terror and most of the footage was unusable.

It's weird how people glaze over it. I've seen it described as ""momentary panic"" on IMDB. Cameron asserts the rats were not abused. The AI summary for it agrees.

But I don't know what else you'd call pinning down 5 innocent animals and drowning them in PFCs to the point where they were shitting themselves. Go ahead and convince me it isn't abuse. Fuck Cameron and everyone that enabled it. And all for the vanity of a filmmaker and scene that absolutely never needed to exist.

This is all the tip of the iceberg for the Abyss that was, by all accounts, an absolutely horrible and unsafe experience for every actor on set. Cameron was pretty happy to let Ed Harris drown for a take so I highly doubt he cares a jot about some rats.

And I did find [a piece](https://www.midrangevancouver.com/posts/2019/6/5/how-the-abyss-became-a-microcosm-for-visual-effects-in-film) saying that some storyboarding for *The Abyss* was done in an early version of what would become Photoshop (presumably shared brother to brother), but that final work on the film was completed on in-house-created software. (Sadly, no citations to follow-up on there.) But if they were using it at the *storyboarding* stage (even just effects storyboarding), that suggests it was in a mature enough state that it probably predated the main effects work on the film.

We needed TVs with passive 3D and they to film in 3D and to add black borders around movies so the edge of the screen would not immediately ruin the immersion. At 1080, that might not have been as appealing, but with 4K it seems like now would be a better time.

The digital projection was just one part of it. Pulling network cable and installing server cabinets were most of the work as every projection attic needed to be wired like a mini data center.  

The studios funded about 70% of it because theaters have very thin margins.  The digital projectors also allowed the movies to be distributed on encrypted hard drives rather than 200lb film reels, which helped with piracy.

Also, by contract the film reels have to be shipped back to the studios after its run, which was a huge expense.  It also eliminated the need for projectionist labor as the scheduled showing could be composed digitally on a pc including trailers and ads.  The IMAX film reels were about 4x that size.

The whole upper body of the Trex has an animatronic, so when it first attacks you see it knees-up and you can tell its physically there. When it starts walking and attacking it becomes CG, but now you've already established to the viewer that its real so we accept it. Then before that wears off, while its moving and attacking they keep cutting in closeups where they can switch back to the animatronic. Trex looks in the window and its pupil really dilates, then it cuts wide and attacks in CG, then it cuts close again and you see just the animatronic face attacking the car, then it cuts wide and flips it.

Tron was 1982. The light cycle chase was clearly CGI. other parts, well, they used computers, so technically CGI, but you decide. [This guy explains the other shots well.](https://youtu.be/PZ7SevBiT5s?t=158). Its not CGI like we understand it and use it today. There were no CGI characters.

[Remember the Terminator skeleton?](https://youtu.be/F76ttUhSkhs?t=27) herky jerky but hey, I was impressed at the time. Unfortunately its not CGI.

according to these guys [the first CGI character was 1985](https://youtu.be/PZ7SevBiT5s?t=84). Fun but not going to blow you away.

VeggieTales was 1993 and took weeks of rendering, but looked better, if not more simplistic (which was why vegetables were chosen).

By 1995 or 1996 it was full stride, IMHO.

Richard Lester was the director and the producers were Alexander and Ilya Salkind. There is more aftermath because they made Superman a few years later and tried to do something similar to film Superman and Superman II together. Their director on that project was Richard Donner. At some point they needed to release the first one to raise funds to finish the second, and their relationship with Donner was frayed. Richard Lester had won a lawsuit against them and knew he wasn't likely to get paid if the movie didn't get finished, so he agreed to work as an uncredited producer and go-between with Donner. They ended up firing Donner, which meant Marlon Brando dropped out of the sequel and Gene Hackman wouldn't come back to finish it. They also hired Lester, who reshot a bunch of II so he could get a director credit. As a result, the actors look different and we see Superman talking to Lara instead of Jor-El in the key scenes (when he gives up his powers, etc.).",diamondsnducks

It was looked at following James Bond films and the like getting rated 12, and the BBFC wanted to have a separate rating for films that would normally be PG but had a small level of violence or strong language- noting that children were growing up faster and to give the choice to parents.

Spiderman was released at the same time, being rated a 12. This annoyed a lot of people including the film makers who’d hoped on merchandise sales to the younger market. Once the 12A came in, the film was re-rated a 12A and so most people think it was the first one, but it was actually The Bourne Identity.

Whenever there was talks of maybe Elijah Wood not being right for Frodo or New Line balking at reshoot costs, reports would show up on AICN with geek calls of ""stop studio interference""! 

The suits at New Line were *pissed* and this led to Peter Jackson having to have a meeting with mantatory attendance for the entire crew. Peter read them the riot act and said that if anyone was caught leaking he'd fire them on the spot. 

Turns out the leaker was Peter. Whenever the studio started to get in his way he'd just write Harry from AICN who would put it up and pressure New Line to back down.

Because of this, the Xbox 360 still used the DVD format for discs. But compared to BD-ROMs which could store about 50GB at the time, DVD-ROMs only had about 8GB available to developers, resulting in larger games requiring two-to-three discs on Xbox 360.

There were two games I know off the top of my head that were negatively affected. Final Fantasy XIII's biggest and most maligned issue was due to lack of freedom of exploration because of this, since each chapter confined players to specific locations and the only open-world area was only unlocked as late as chapter 10 of 13.

And Mass Effect 2's story had to be split into acts due to not all of the content fitting onto a single disc. There's a ton of cut content showing that players could've recruited teammates in any order they wanted, but party recruitment missions were split across Discs 1 and 2 with the player forced into key story missions at the end of each disc (you couldn't even do side quests or go to hub worlds) once every available teammate was acquired.

As the biggest evidence of this, there are audio lines for >!Legion!<, the last-available teammate you can recruit in the game, in every mission of the game, including the first few story moments of the game where he's not available. By that point, the only available mission you can perform >!aside from the level playing as Joker!< is the game's final level.",res30stupid

In the first LOTR trilogy all the New Zealand actors weren't allowed any residuals so actors like Karl Urban, whereas the actors from the UK and elsewhere, like Ian McKellen did. So the first 3 LOTR films happen and are a big success.

It comes to the Hobbit trilogy and all the New Zealand actors, including all the background actors, want to be able to get residuals so go on strike so they can get them. Peter Jackson supported them and wanted to get this resolved so it didn't happen again.

The film's producers negotiate with the New Zealand government and basically say sort this or we films elsewhere

Tourism is heavily dependant on LOTR so the government desperately want this to go ahead. They also don't want all the other productions taff to lose their jobs, backstage crew, hospice staff, artists, set builders etc. The prime minister, who had a background at the bank of America helped solve this issue, he's affectionately known as the smiling assassin because of the way he sacked hundreds in 1 go so you don't need to know much more about him.

They passed a law that actors aren't officially employees anymore and are individual contractors with the production, effectively ending the strike because they are no longer employees and can't organise strikes.

The Hobbit films go ahead and are great for tourism, they build a real live Hobbiton and tourism is great but that law remains in place for the whole acting industry in New Zealand.

There were rumblings that the law is going to be fixed but then Amazon then wants to begin filming The Rings of Power and the same issue comes up. Amazon wanted tax breaks like the Hobbit films got in order to film In the country or they move to Scotland. They got all their tax breaks and they filmed in New Zealand but COVID happened and now they've filmed series 2 in the UK and New Zealand still has the ""Hobbit"" law to this day.",Gsampson97

He showed Peter Jackson a method of pre-visualization, where a CGI scene could be created as a virtual storyboard before fully committing to rendering. In the end, these two directors each pushed movie effects into what they are today -- each with the goal of doing their trilogies justice.""

So basically my point stands. Without Lucas and Star Wars, many wouldn't have chosen to do a full CGI character like Gollum and even go the route to improve said technology. The Gollum method was inspired by Jar Jar Binks and evolved on that (if i remember correctly, Gollum wasn't supposed to be CGI at first). The biggest milestones were A new Hope and The phantom menace. They laid the foundation of what others would build on it.  I know from interviews that without Star Wars, Jurassic park or lotr wouldn't have existed in the way like they do today.

Jar Jar was THE first CGI character. But my whole point was that Peter Jackson expanded on that idea because they saw how a jar jar worked on screen. Then they decided to focus on the facial capturing because the ground work for basic body mocap was already there. My whole point is actually only, without Jar Jar we wouldn't have got that great iteration of Gollum. Also we wouldn't have T-Rex because of the CGI droids in Episode One. The whole industry agreed that both a new Hope and episode 1 were inspirational for all the great effect studios that came after.

Just add to my original comment, there are, of course, some movies with animals as the leads where they don’t talk. In this category, Benji is probably the top dog (pardon the pun). But in most movies where animals are the lead actors and humans are secondary, the animals either talk or think at each other. 

The original Incredible Journey (1963) is a good one, although it does have a narrator who tells you what they’re thinking. I wonder how it would play with just the music and the sound effects tracks. (Next movie night…)

When I think of the live action 101 Dalmatians movie, it’s hard to imagine them not talking, because of course they talk in the animated version. It was a really remarkable choice on the part of the filmmakers, and amazing that Disney went along with it.

The internet tells me that the live action Jungle Book (1994) also had no talking animals(!). I just watched a clip. Remarkable.",LEGODamashii

And I'm not glossing over anything. Painting anyone who was connected to the film as a murderer whether they were involved in any of the decision making or not is ridiculous. Assign blame where blame lies. Not everyone working on the movie, the Landis directed portion of it, or even that specific scene, is culpable. The blame lands on the decision makers. I'm not sure Kennedy was that, she was not as big then as she is now. 

We know for sure that Landis made a series of unnecessary decisions, bad decisions, careless decisions, and I'm 100% on board with calling him a child murderer and a scumbag. He's never shown remorse. He's a huge piece of shit.

Kennedy was a witness to some of the decisions, and in part to protect Landis she fled (was sent?) to Europe. Attempting to withhold witness testimony, to prevent evidence from coming to light or whatever, that's extremely scummy. I'm not defending her character, I'm not absolving her of the things we know she specifically did do.

But you can't just paint with a broad brush and call everyone a murderer because of a tangential involvement. What about the crew? Are they murderers? The grips who set up lights? The camera operator for filming the scene of the murder? What about Vic Morrow? He was carrying one of the children when the crash occurred and killed him. If you're just painting everyone involved as a murderer, then according to you even one of the *victims* is also a fucking murderer because he was walking through the river. Just set aside the fact that he had been told he'd be safe. Set aside the fact that he was just doing his job. Set aside the fact that *he was also murdered*. Involved at all? Murderer. And when everyone is a murderer, then it kinda lessens the impact on those who actually should be labeled it. It will especially make your argument sound hollow and disingenuous when you intentionally blame people who were not actually involved.

What about the pyrotechnic operator who quit in protest? He could have prevented the accident if he didn't quit, thus, according to you, he's also a murderer. The helicopter pilot who obeyed the direction to fly lower? He could have not done that, therefore murderer. You see how ridiculous your take is?

John Landis is a murderer. He broke regulations and rules, he ordered the helicopter pilot to fly lower. He ordered for the pyrotechnics to be used in an unsafe manner. He brought the children onto set despite it breaking child labor laws. He ordered the victims into place. He set up the whole accident in such a fool hardy way it looks nearly intentional in hindsight.

Blame the people responsible. Blame John Landis.

Kennedy was never even charged with anything. Everything she did related to the deaths was all at the behest of her bosses. She wasn't Lucasfilm President back then. She was girlfriend to a manager. Blame Kathleen Kennedy for what she *did* do.",OobaDooba72

In the 80s Tippet invented a technique called ""Go-Motion"" that used partially articulated, digitally-controlled stop motion puppets. He'd pose the puppet for one frame, take a digital snapshot of how the limbs were positioned, then set up for the next frame. The puppet could then be moved from one pose to the next, and the camera would take the shot as it moved. This introduced motion blur into the frame and made for much more realistic animation (first used for *Dragonslayer*, whose dragon effects blew me away as a teen).

Anyway, the animation armatures used for the CGI dinosaurs in *Jurassic Park* were adapted versions the same kind of mechanism, just used in reverse. This enabled stop motion artists -- you know, the folks who'd spent their lives perfecting how to replicate the way animals moved -- to use those skills together with the new CGI tech.

I think 3D failed at home because they made the TVs expensive AND most importantly, companies like Sony and Samsung pushed their active 3D bullshit. Glasses were super expensive and they basically gave you 1 or 2 when you bought your TV. To watch Avatar at home in 3D with my family would have cost over $500 and would have had to preplan all the charging of glasses.

Sony and Samsung have hardware divisions they needed to fondle and that's why they wanted to sell expensive glasses

The only other thing worth noting is that the barrel obstruction was an actual bullet. The same gun had been previously loaded with a squib round, which is kind of the opposite of a blank, for a closeup scene. A blank has full powder, but no bullet, where a squib has a bullet but no powder. A blank is meant to *sound* real, while a squib is meant to *look* real. In this case, the squib still had a primer charge when the trigger was pulled on it and only had enough power to separate the bullet from the cartridge and lodge it into the barrel. An important note here is that squibs aren't supposed to have primers in them. The next round loaded into that gun was a blank with a full powder charge, which was enough to dislodge the squib bullet with lethal force.

To sum up, the squib round wasn't supposed to have a primer, the armorer should have cleared the barrel when he unloaded the squib and noticed the bullet part was missing from it, and any firearms firing blanks should be checked for barrel obstructions prior to use anyway.",kcox1980

It’s also physically more difficult to move fluid in and out of the lungs as compared to air, so the respiratory muscles have to work harder.

There seems to be some renewed interest in perfluorocarbons now as a potential method of targeted drug delivery to lung tissue, rather than as an oxygenation mechanism. Though a spray looks to be as effective as wholesale breathing of the stuff.",NorthernSparrow

1fxxgrt,Movies whose productions had unintended consequences on the film industry. ,lqs46st,2024-10-07 14:22:21,"So, as it happens I am a physiologist and I teach about this stuff. Liquid itself is not necessarily a problem; it’s the concentration of oxygen that matters. The reason that breathing in water suffocates people is not because water is a fluid, it’s because water has a much, much lower oxygen concentration than air (water has about 300 times less O2, on a per-liter basis). So for example, breathing in very-low-O2 air will suffocate someone just as efficiently as breathing in water.

So, perfluorocarbon fluids can hold O2 very effectively, such that they have an O2 concentration comparable to air. Put that in the lungs, and O2 will move just fine into the blood. O2 will diffuse on its own from a higher-O2 substance (the perfluorocarbon, or air) to a lower-O2 substance (body fluids) if the two substances are put very close to each other with just a thin cell layer separating them. That’s how gills work, and that’s how lungs work too - simple diffusion. In a way the lungs are one of our simplest organs: they’re just a bag of air surrounded by blood vessels, and simple diffusion takes care of the rest.

Ventilation of the lungs can proceed regardless of whether the substance being moved is air or a fluid. (In a sense air behaves as a fluid anyway, just a low-density fluid) Ventilation involves expanding the lungs to pull air or fluid in, and contracting the lungs to push it back out, and the muscles involved as largely the same. Though, one issue is that since liquids are heavier than air, the ventilatory muscles do have to work harder, particularly during exhalation. When breathing air, the natural elastic recoil of the lungs is enough that exhalation can be passive (just relax all the muscles and the lungs automatically shrink a bit); when breathing a fluid, one has to engage what are called the “accessory muscles” of ventilation, which enable a powered exhalation. Normally we would only use the accessory muscles when working out hard, so breathing a fluid feels like you have to pant hard. 

So that’s the principle. The theory is sound, and it has even been through successful human clinical trials. But the extra work of ventilation, coupled with an apparently unpleasant sensation of fluid in the trachea, has meant it hasn’t found a practical real-world application.",NorthernSparrow

Sting, the wrestler, does have a trademark for the name 'Sting,' 

HOWEVER, it is recorded as 'For: entertainment services, namely live and televised performances by a professional wrestler.'

Important because when it comes to trademarks you can't just trademark a word without specifying application or usage.

For example, 'Roman Reigns' is trademarked, broadly, as 'For: Entertainment services, namely, wrestling exhibitions....' It is also trademarked, specifically, as 'For: toys, namely action figures, accessories....' and 'For clothing, namely, tops, shirts, jackets, bottoms, pants....'

So for the story to be true, Sting, the wrestler, would need broad and near exclusive rights to the name and trademark across a variety of applications (live performances, apparel, etc.) for Sting, the musician, to infringe upon it, and need to compensate Sting, the wrestler.

And unless Sting, the musician, is entering the wrestling ring, he has never and will never have to rent the name or pay to use it.",emelbee923

I liked Hexum quite a bit when I was a kid, watching ""Voyagers!""  He had a bright future ahead of him, and made a tragic mistake that cost him his life.

For all that, though -- a couple of bright spots, courtesy of his Wikipedia page:

> With his mother's permission, his body was flown to San Francisco on life support, where his heart was transplanted into a 36-year-old Las Vegas man at California Pacific Medical Center. 
 Hexum's kidneys and corneas were also donated: One cornea went to a 66-year-old man, the other to a young girl. One of the kidney recipients was a critically ill five-year-old boy, and the other was a 43-year-old grandmother of three who had waited eight years for a kidney. Skin that was donated was used to treat a 3+1⁄2-year-old boy with third-degree burns.

The 360 was the weaker console but the cheaper price of entry made a massive difference in its popularity. That's what made those seemingly minor differences such a big deal.

I'll gladly be corrected but the complacency, as far as the regulations go, didn't seem to really be on the rest of the crew who were not, by the regs, required to do that work. 

I never handle a firearm without saftying it myself, and that's due to training and abiding by the regulations of my country/province.

It wasn't just that the T-Rex found them, it's that it was often a shock. But this same 40 foot tall, 8 ton monster was also described as shaking the earth when it walked. Somehow this massive creature always seemed to SNEAK UP ON THEM.

Kinda! Those loading screens in that era were doing just that. With the integration of hard drives or solid state drives into the game design, games writ large could cut those out entirely. Naturally this started on PC before, once SSDs were commonplace. Now we're at a point where loading screens are added to games strictly for pacing because people expect it.",None

Crichton was a great at research, but limited to information at the time (such as the famed Velociraptors). This one is factually correct to this day so far.

In that in the movie it's actually just an animal like everything in the book is. In the book it's like a horror monster. It just keeps showing up to hunt them over and over again.

It's possible the studios might receive something extra from Sony for doing this but there's really no concrete proof of this as of yet. Nonetheless, it's only PlayStation consoles that does this meaning that custom save/load screens will have to be made for other platforms anyway. Perhaps the most striking example of this happens to be Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep. Since it's very first appearance for PSP, it has always used save/load screens provided by the console's OS even as a part of the later ReMix collections on PS3 and PS4. And as fate would have it, the game would later get ports outside the PlayStations ecosystem starting with Xbox One c. 2020 or so and it was only by then that BBS would finally get a save/load screen of it's very own to match the other KH titles.
